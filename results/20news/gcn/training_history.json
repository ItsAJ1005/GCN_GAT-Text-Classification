abode in 'fanatic' turkey when they were expelled from europe, especially spain, by saintly christians, and they have lived here for centuries in at least as much tranquility and liberty as their fellow turkish subjects, all being exposed alike to the rapacity of their common rulers. to one brought up, as most americans have been, in the gladstonian and foreign-missionary tradition, the condition of the jews in turkey is almost a mathematical demonstration that religious differences have had an influence in the tragedy of turkey only as they were combined with aspirations for a political separation which every nation in the world would have treated as treasonable. one readily reaches the conclusion that the jews in turkey were fortunate...\" he also stated that: \"they [armenians] traitorously turned turkish cities over to the russian invader; that they boasted of having raised an army of one hundred and fifty thousand men to fight a civil war, and that they burned

ottoman empire and the turkish republic, and turkey and the holocaust: turkey's role in rescuing turkish and european jewry from nazi persecution, 1933-45. shaw chairs the undergraduate interdepartmental degree program in near eastern studies and has organized the program for the study of ottoman and turkish jewry. he is affiliated with the g. e. von grunebaum center for near eastern studies. editor: how did you come to write these two books on turkey and european and turkish jews? shaw: basically, i'm an ottoman historian, but i'm also jewish. i've spent twenty-five years studying ottoman history, and as time went along, whenever i found materials on the ottoman jews, i collected them. but i never did anything with them until a couple of years ago, when i suddenly realized that 1992 was the 500th anniversary of the jews being expelled from spain and coming to turkey. then the sephardic temple down on wilshire avenue invited me to give a series of three lectures on ottoman jewry. these lectures were greatly appreciated, and i became motivated to undertake further research to develop a book, the jews of the ottoman empire and the turkish) republic. this book is quite different from the works of most jewish historians, who tend to look at the jews in any country more from the viewpoint of the jews and the jewish community, and rely mainly on jewish sources. i view my subject as an ottoman historian, and i approach the jews of the ottoman empire largely from the point of view of ottoman society, using largely ottoman sources. after i finished this book and sent it to the press, i came across additional documents relating to turkish jews during world war ii. in the completed book, i had said that turkey had done a good deal to rescue the jews during world war ii, but i did not actually have many details. then i found a batch of documents in the foreign ministry archive relating to actions taken by turkish diplomats to help the jews before and during the holocaust. it was too late to add this new information to the book in press, so i decided to write a second book. i conducted further research, mainly in the archives of the foreign ministry in ankara and the turkish embassy and consulate in paris. the result was the second book, turkey and the holocaust, which details how turkey helped rescue jews from the nazis. - how exactly did they do this? the story takes place over a number of years. the book presents the material in three parts, first of which deals with the period before the holocaust. when the nazis came to power in germany in 1933, they immediately started dismissing jews and anti-nazi germans from universities, hospitals, scientific institutes, and the like. turkey at that moment was just beginning the process of reforming its universities, and it saw in these jews, who were being fired from their positions in germany, a good source of new talent to help modernize the turkish universities. within three months after the nazis started dismissing these jews, turkey arranged to take many of them in. they were brought to turkey and were given appointments as professors in the turkish universities, as heads of scientific institutes, and as medical personnel in hospitals. about 300 to 500 major jewish professors came to turkey in the 1930s. ernst reuter, a german political scientist, spent the war years teaching political science in turkey. after world war ii, he was mayor of berlin during the berlin airlift. fritz neimark, a major german jewish economist, came to turkey and helped establish a modern school of economics in istanbul. a man named reichenbach, who was rescued from the nazis by turkey and spent the war years in turkey, eventually came to ucla, where he became a professor of philosophy. other german jewish emigres engaged in cultural activities in turkey. one such was karl ebert, who had been a leading theatrical producer in berlin until he was expelled by the nazis. he went to turkey, where he organized the turkish national theater and the turkish national opera company in ankara, with the help of paul hindemuth. so the first section of the book covers this first phase, when jews were being persecuted in germany and rescued by turkey. oddly enough, the german emigres, when they were in turkey, did not seem to think too badly of germany. they regarded themselves more as germans than jews, and they did not join in the anti-nazi activities of the local turkish jewish community. i even found letters from the nazi representatives to turkey praising these german jewish refugees for their work in promoting the idea of german culture. even though these people had been persecuted by the nazis and rescued by the turks, they shared the nazis' feelings of aryan racial superiority over the turks. the second part of the book deals with the holocaust, which began in 1940 when the nazis occupied france. in europe at that time, and especially in france, there were about 20,000 turkish jews. they had migrated to europe for various reasons from about the turn of the century onward. most of them had settled in europe during the turkish war for independence after world war i, when greece was threatening to overrun turkey. the greeks had persecuted the jews throughout the nineteenth century, and the jews feared what might happen to them if the greeks took over in turkey. many jews fled to france during the 1920s and 1930s. many also abandoned their turkish citizenship and became french citizens. suddenly the nazis invaded france in 1940 and started introducing all sorts of anti-jewish laws. the turkish jews soon found that it was not worth very much to be a french jew, but that it was worth a lot to be a turkish jew. - how so? turkey remained neutral through most of world war ii. it retained its embassies and consulates in all the nazi-occupied countries until it finally entered the war on the side of the allies at the end of 1944. during the war, therefore, turkey was in a position to defend its citizens against anti-jewish measures, and the actions that turkish diplomats took form the second chapter of the book. turkish diplomats who were stationed in france in particular intervened to protect jews of turkish citizenship from the nazis. for those turkish jews who had retained their turkish citizenship, there was generally no problem. if they were arrested and sent to a concentration camp, the turkish diplomats would communicate with the commanders of the camp and other officials and say in effect: \"these people are turkish citizens. you can't do this to them.\" and the turkish jews would be released. if their businesses were confiscated, the turkish diplomats would protest and the businesses would be restored. the nazis in general wanted to keep the friendship of turkey. they hoped to be able to use turkey as a gateway for an invasion of the middle east, and they also wanted to obtain chromium and manganese from turkey. in order to keep turkish friendship, they usually accepted these interventions on behalf of turkish jews. the turkish diplomats sometimes went to the concentration camps to secure the release of turkish jews. at times they even boarded trains hauling turkish jews to auschwitz for extermination and succeeded in getting them off the train. most of the foreign jews were sent to a concentration camp at a place called drancy in paris, and that's where most of the intercession by turkish consuls took place. the greater problem came with the turkish jews who had abandoned their turkish citizenship and had become french citizens. the consuls couldn't declare that these people were turkish citizens because they were not. my book includes photographs of jews lining up in front of the turkish consulate, either to get passports to return to turkey or to get a restoration of their turkish citizenship. this was a bureaucratic matter, so processing the application would take some time. in the meantime it was a real emergency, because the nazis would arrest jews on the streets for almost nothing. the nazis would even arrest them if they had radios or telephones in their apartments, because radios and telephones were forbidden to jews. to take care of these former turkish jews, the turkish diplomats invented a document called gayri muntazem vatandash, or \"irregular fellow citizen.\" the document said in effect \"this person is a former turkish citizen who has applied for the restoration of his turkish citizenship. in the meantime we would appreciate it if you would treat him as if he were a turkish citizen.\" the diplomats wrote the document in turkish and put their seals on it. since the nazis could not read turkish, on the whole they accepted these papers as certificates of citizenship. by this means, the turkish diplomats were able to rescue many jews who had relinquished their turkish citizenship. actually the nazis were of two minds about the turkish defense of jews. on the one hand the nazi foreign ministry, which wanted to retain the friendship of turkey, was in favor of accepting these interventions. on the other hand, himmler and eichmann wanted all jews exterminated. at times himmler and eichmann were able to prevail and some of the turkish jews were sent off to auschwitz before the turkish consuls could do anything. - do you have statistics on how many turkish jews were rescued? there were about 20,000 turkish jews in europe before world war ii, about 10,000 of whom were living in france. most of the information in this section of the book relates to the situation in france. i have published the letters that the turkish consuls sent to the nazi officials and the letters that came back in reply. generally the nazis said that if the turkish consul would present documents certifying that arrested individuals are turkish citizens, and promise to send them out of france, the nazis would release them from the concentration camp. the turkish consuls also organized special trains to take turkish jews from nazi-occupied territory back to turkey. these trains ran regularly in 1943 and 1944. the nazis gave the turkish jews visas so they could pass out of nazi territory, but the trains were often held up by the nazi-influenced governments of eastern europe - croatia, serbia, and bulgaria - because these governments really didn't want the jews to escape. as a result of the turkish consuls' efforts, about 3,000 to 4,000 of the turkish jews in france were saved. another 3,000 were sent off to auschwitz, where most of them died. the remaining 3,000 either escaped across the border into spain or fled to the area of southern france occupied by the italians, who treated jews much better than the nazis did. at the end of 1943, however, italy fell out of the war, and that was the end for those jews as well. incidentally, the turkish diplomats in nazi-occupied greece also worked to rescue jews in that country. - the second part of your book then deals with turkish diplomats acting to rescue jews of turkish citizenship or turkish origin from nazi persecution. yes, and there is an aside i might add here: in their interventions on behalf of turkish jews, the turks cited their treaty with germany which stated that turkish citizens in german territory would be treated the same as german citizens in turkey. on that basis the turks maintained that the nazis could not discriminate against turkish citizens who are jews. the nazis claimed (and the vichy government agreed) that they were not discriminating because they were treating all jews equally. turkey protested, saying, \"you are dividing our citizens according to religion, but the turkish constitution requires that all citizens be treated equally, regardless of religion. therefore, you cannot single out turkish jews.\" american consuls in paris, by contrast, accepted the nazi argument and told american jews who were being persecuted by the nazis that they couldn't do anything about it, because the american jews were being treated the same as other jews. the third part of the book takes place in turkey, which was the principal center during the holocaust for activities aimed at the rescue of eastern european jews. the kwish agency, an organization established by jews in palestine to help resettle jews to palestine, set up an office in istanbul in 1940 under the leadership of chaim barlas. other jewish organizations in palestine, especially the kibbutzes, also sent representatives to istanbul to set up headquarters. these groups first tried to contact jews in eastern europe to find out what was happening. today we know about the holocaust, but at that time people didn't know what was going on. they didn't imagine the nazis could do the things they were doing. and so the first step was to get information, and the turkish government let them use the turkish mails to send letters to their relatives and friends in eastern europe. the jewish organizations found out what was happening when they received replies. later on when the nazis began to intercept such letters, the jews received assistance also from the vatican nuncio, angelo roncali, who served as the vatican representative in istanbul from 1935 to 1944 and later became pope john xxiii. as the vatican representative during the war, he used the facilities of the catholic church to supplement what the turkish government was doing to assist jewish agencies in contacting jews in eastern europe. with the cooperation of the turkish government, these agencies then sent hard currency, food, clothing, and even railroad and steamship tickets to jews in czechoslovakia, bulgaria, romania, and hungary. they weren't able to help much in poland because by then the nazis had wiped out almost all the polish jews. whenever possible the rescue agencies arranged for the jews to get out of eastern europe either by train through the so called orient express route to istanbul, or by boat through the black sea to istanbul. turkey was not eager for all these refugees to remain within its borders during the war, because it was being blockaded and was suffering terrible shortages of food and clothing. the government, therefore, facilitated the movement of the non-turkish jewish refugees from turkey to palestine, either by the taurus express railroad through the mountains to syria and palestine, or by small boats across the eastern mediterranean from southern turkey to palestine. these efforts were bitterly opposed not only by the nazis, but also by the british, who did not want any more jewish immigration to palestine because they feared it would hurt their relations with the arabs. the british constantly pressured the turkish government to stop this traffic and send those jews back. in a few cases the turkish government, yielding to british pressure, did send the boats back. for example, in one incident, the steamship struma, with some 700 jewish refugees from romania, was sent back by the turkish government as a result of the intervention of the british ambassador. when that ship was sunk by a soviet submarine, all were lost except one person. nevertheless, all told, the turkish government allowed no fewer than 100,000 eastern european jews to pass through turkish territory and move on to palestine during the second world war. the turkish authorities also provided these refugees with facilities and money, and gave them permission to send money and food out of the country. - many of these jews who passed through turkey may still be living in israel. yes, and their children. but let's return for a moment to the first group, the turkish jews who came from europe. they did not go on to palestine; they stayed in turkey. it was the non-turkish, eastern european jews who passed through turkey en route to palestine. their story is very interesting. - and you have rescued it from obscurity. many studies have been made of the holocaust, but most of them do not focus on the eastern european or middle eastern jews. most of the scholarship has centered on the western european jews, of whom 6 million were massacred by the nazis. my study deals with a much smaller number of people. i have tried to round out the picture, and i hope my book will persuade other scholars to undertake further investigations in the history of eastern jews. when it comes to numbers, the german jews were also relatively small in number. most of the millions slain were polish jews. the rescue of 100,000 eastern european jews may not seem so significant compared with the total of 6 million who were murdered, but it meant a lot to those who were saved. about three-fourths of the book consists of documents - translations of many documents. they are included because the story is not well known. not only are people in the west unaware of the courageous actions of the turkish diplomats; even the people of turkey did not know the story. i felt that they would not fully understand this remarkable achievement unless they could see the documents. - what languages are used in the documents? most of them are in turkish or french; some are in hebrew. there is a great deal of material in hebrew about the organization of the boats going to palestine, the passengers, and so on, but i did not go into those details extensively. i describe mostly what turkey did, so most of my documents are in turkish or french. a few documents are in english. the jewish groups in istanbul did not necessarily cooperate with one another to rescue jews; in fact, they often fought with one another. they took turns trying to get the turkish government to deport rival groups. for example, some of the kibbutz groups felt that the jewish agency was run by western european jews who were interested only in helping western european jews. finally, in 1944, president roosevelt sent a personal representative, ira hirschman, who had been an executive of bloomingdale's department store in new york city, and hirschman managed to reconcile their differences. the documents related to his mission are in english. i also obtained many documents from serge klarsfeld, a holocaust historian in france, who mainly worked on the french jews. (his father was killed by the nazis.) he gave me materials he had gathered in the german archives on the turkish jews, so i didn't personally consult the german archives. i believe that much more can be learned from the german archives, and i hope someone someday will make the effort. - this new book fits in well with your teaching, doesn't it? right. i'm giving a course on the history of the jews of the ottoman empire. i first gave the course two years ago. in addition to research, writing, and teaching, i've been actively involved in the commemoration of the 500th anniversary of the coming of the jews to the ottoman empire. among other things, i helped organize a large international conference on the subject which was held in istanbul in 1992. - now that your books are finished and the conference has taken place, what do you plan to do next? i'm working on two new books. one is a history of the turkish war for independence, which took place after world war i, during the years 1918 to 1923. the turks warded off the efforts of the victorious european powers to occupy turkey and end its independence. the second book is a study of sultan abdul hamid ii, the last major sultan, who ruled from 1876 to 1909. he was an important modernizer in his own way, although he also suppressed all sorts of political movements. stanford j. shaw received a b.a. in history and an m.a. in british history. he then shifted to near eastern history, earning a second m.a. and a ph.d. at princeton. as a doctoral candidate at princeton, he spent two years abroad, studying at the school of oriental and african studies, university of london; the university of cairo, the american university at cairo, and the university of istanbul. he taught at harvard before coming to ucla in 1966. his postdoctoral research has been supported by the john simon guggenheim foundation, the american research institute in turkey, the social science research council, the national endowment for the humanities, the fulbright program, and isop. he has received honorary degrees from harvard university and bosporus university, bebek, istanbul, turkey, and medals of honor for lifetime contributions to the fields of islamic and turkish studies from the center for research in islamic history, art, and culture in istanbul and from the american friends of turkey in washington, d.c. in addition to undertaking many professional service activities and public lectures in both the united states and turkey, shaw has also produced eight books and one edited volume. his history of the ottoman empire and modem turkey (2 vols.) has been published in many editions (six editions or reprints from 1977-1991), and translated into turkish (1983, 1991) and french (1984). his book the jews of the ottoman empire and the turkish republic (macmillan, london, and new york university press, 1992) will be published in turkish translation by the turkish historical society, istanbul. his turkey and the holocaust: turkey's role in rescuing turkish and european jewry from nazi persecution, 1933-1945 will be published by macmillan publishers, london, and new york university press in 1993. a pamphlet summarizing the book was published in ankara, turkey, in 1992. serdar argic",

            "when an alleged private revelation attracts sufficient attention, the church may investigate it. if the investigation indicates a likelihood that the alleged private revelation is in fact from god, it will be approved. that means that it can be preached in the church. however, it is still true that no one is required to believe that it came from god. a catholic is free to deny the authenticity of even the most well attested and strongly approved private revelations, such as those at fatima and lourdes. (i suspect that few if any catholics do reject fatima and lourdes, but if any do their rejection of them does not mean they are not orthodox catholics in good standing.) it may be a bit much to say that a catholic is free to deny what happened at fatima. that's a bit strong, it is sort of like saying that a catholic is free to deny that hong kong exists. what a catholic *is* free to do is to deny the truth of fatima, without being called a heretic. you can be labeled other things for such an offense, but not a heretic. theologians make a basic distinction as far as the degree of assent one must give to events like fatima and lourdes. things revealed by god through jesus christ or his apostles must be given the assent due to a revelation of god: total and unswerving. fatima and lourdes demand our assent as much as any other well-attested event in human history. perhaps a bit more, given the approval of the church. \"approval\" of an apparition by the church principally means that whatever happened was in harmony with the catholic faith. i personally think of private revelations as our lord's way of telling us what to do at particular periods in history. he gave us all the doctrines, etc., 2000 years ago, but we can always use some help in knowing how exactly to apply what he gave us. catholic devotion to the sacred heart was a result of a series of apparitions to st. margaret mary alacoque, for example. the problem at the time was extreme moral rigorism that was turning our lord into someone without a heart.",

            "how quaint of you to point this out, and then to completely ignore all of the blatant lies you've trotted out. the scenario and genocide staged by the armenians 78 years ago in eastern anatolia and x-soviet armenia is being reenacted again - this time in azerbaijan. there are remarkable similarities between the plots, the perpetrators, and the underdogs. remember, in article <2bac262d.25249@news.service.uci.edu>, you have blatantly lied and still have not corrected yourself. i'll let the rest of the net judge this on its own merits. source: 'the sunday times,' 1 march 1992 (a british weekly, written by thomas goltz, from agdam, azerbaijan.) armenian soldiers massacre hundreds of fleeing families. the spiralling violence gripping the outer republics of the former soviet union gained new impetus yesterday with cold-blooded slaughter of hundreds of women and children in war-racked nagorno-karabakh. survivors reported that armenian soldiers shot and bayoneted more than 450 azeris, many of them women and children, who were fleeing an attack on their town. hundreds, possibly thousands, were missing and feared dead. the attackers killed most of the soldiers and volunteers defending the women and children. they then turned their guns on the terrified refugees. the few survivors later described what happened:\" that's when the real slaughter began,\" said azer hajiev, one of three soldiers to survive. \"the armenians just shot and shot. and then they came in and started carving up people with their bayonets and knives.\" \" they were shooting, shooting, shooting\", echoed rasia aslanova, who arrived in agdam with other women and children who made their way through armenian lines. she said her husband, kayun, and a son-in-law were killed in front of her. her daughter was still missing. one boy who arrived in agdam had an ear sliced off. the survivors said 2000 others, some of whom had fled separately, were still missing in the gruelling terrain; many could perish from their wounds or the cold. by late yesterday, 479 deaths had been registered at the morgue in agdam's morgue, and 29 bodies had been buried in the cemetery. of the seven corpses i saw awaiting burial, two were children and three were women, one shot through the chest at point blank range. agdam hospital was a scene of carnage and terror. doctors said they had 140 patients who escaped slaughter, most with bullet injuries or deep stab wounds. nor were they safe in agdam. on friday night rockets fell on the city which has a population of 150,000, destroying several buildings and killing one person. now wait, there is more. it's inhumane to ignore this violence the stories of survivors of karabag massacre: 69 year old hatin nine telling: -''my twin grandchildren were cut to pieces in front of my eyes. they told me: we won't kill you. but the babies have to die in front of your eyes.'' 72 year old huseyin ibrahimoglu: - ''our turkish village in khojalu town was blown up in two hours. turks, you must die.'' 28 year old gulsum huseyin: - ''they bayonetted my 3 year old daughter in her stomach in front of my eyes.'' are these stories lies? have the eye-witnesses been day-dreaming? were these stories forged by turkish journalists in the region? the nonsense of such a claim is clear from the writings of british journalists, too. two days before we had quoted from a sunday times article. they[british] reported the events in karabag even before turkish journalists. what is more here are the pictures. pictures of people who were bayonetted, whose eyes were gouged, ears cut off. even the armenian radio couldn't claim these \"lies.\" they are saying \"exaggeration.\" that means ''somethings'' have happened but the situation is not as bad as reported. perhaps that village of khojalu town was destroyed in 4 hours, instead of 2... or gulsum huseyin's 3 year old daughter was bayonetted in her chest instead of stomach... the massacre is clearly seen with all its dimensions. the effects of this massacre on karabag and environs cannot be reduced by any word. some of the western press', led by some french newspapers, ability to ''close their eyes'' is nothing but complicity in this massacre. yesterday we gave samples from le figaro. until yesterday's print no news about the real events in karabag were printed. so were the french tv channels.. the subject they considered related to karabag was ''the necessity of protecting armenians against azeri attacks.'' the age we are living in is termed a human rights age. there are lots of organizations such as united nations and csce(conference on security and cooperation in europe), and rules, all designed to fight against human rights violations. international reactions must be made with international cooperation. with support of everybody and every organization claiming to be civilized. could there be a more serious human rights violation than that of the right to live -and with such levels of barbarity and cruelty-?

            "being a parent in need of some help, i ask that you bear with me while i describe the situation which plagues me... i am a divorced father. chance would have it that \"my weekend\" with my daughter has fallen upon easter weekend this year. although i am presbyterian, i had married a catholic woman. we decided that the catholic moray of indoctrination of the spouse into the faith was too confining (and restrictive due to time as we had already set a date), and we were married in a christian church which was non-denominational. during the years of our marriage, we did not often attend church. when our daughter was born, some years later, my wife insisted that she be baptised as catholic. this wasn't a problem with me. during a separation of five years, my ex-wife was taken ill with a disease that affected her mental capacities. she was confined to a mental ward for two months before it was diagnosed. it has since been treated \"effectively\". in other words, professionals have deemed her a functioning member of society. during the recuperation, my ex-wife has embraced buddism. her influence over my daughter has been substantial, and has primarily allowed me only saturday visitation for a number of years. during this period i have read bible study books to my daughter, and tried to keep her aware of her christian heritage. last fall, our divorce was finalized after a year of viscious divorce hearings. at that time i was awarded visitation rights every other weekend. at that time, i started taking my daughter to church quite often, although not every weekend. i did this to attempt to strengthen the christian ethic and expose her to a religious community. today, easter sunday, i took my daughter to church. when it came time for communion, my daughter took the bread (the body of christ) but left the wine (the blood of christ) professing that she was too young for wine. she then balled the bread up in her hand and tried to descretely throw it under the pew in front of us. i feel this was a slap in the face to me, my religion, and an afront to her religious heritage. it can be construed as breaking several of the commandments if you try. i really felt dishonored by the action. my daughter is only nine years old, but i think she should have been old and mature enough to realize her actions. i have difficulty blaming her directly for religious teachings her mother swears to, but when i discussed this with my daughter she made it clear she believed in buddhism and not christianity. my initial response of anger (moderated) was to suggest if there is no faith in christ then why does she celebrate easter, or christmas? i suggested i would never force her to practice my religious beliefs by celebrating holidays with her again. i do not want to \"drive her from the fold\", and would be willing to allow her to continue practicing buddhism (as though i had a choice seeing her only for two days out of fourteen) but i want her to want to embrace christianity. any suggestions? if you have a response, please e-mail me a copy.

[2] why use jpeg? there are two good reasons: to make your image files smaller, and to store 24-bit-per-pixel color data instead of 8-bit-per-pixel data. making image files smaller is a big win for transmitting files across networks and for archiving libraries of images. being able to compress a 2 mbyte full-color file down to 100 kbytes or so makes a big difference in disk space and transmission time! (if you are comparing gif and jpeg, the size ratio is more like four to one. more details below.) if your viewing software doesn't support jpeg directly, you'll have to convert jpeg to some other format for viewing or manipulating images. even with a jpeg-capable viewer, it takes longer to decode and view a jpeg image than to view an image of a simpler format (gif, for instance). thus, using jpeg is essentially a time/space tradeoff: you give up some time in order to store or transmit an image more cheaply. it's worth noting that when network or phone transmission is involved, the time savings from transferring a shorter file can be much greater than the extra time to decompress the file. i'll let you do the arithmetic yourself. the other reason why jpeg will gradually replace gif as a standard usenet posting format is that jpeg can store full color information: 24 bits/pixel (16 million colors) instead of 8 or less (256 or fewer colors). if you have only 8-bit display hardware then this may not seem like much of an advantage to you. within a couple of years, though, 8-bit gif will look as obsolete as black-and-white macpaint format does today. furthermore, for reasons detailed in section 7, jpeg is far more useful than gif for exchanging images among people with widely varying color display hardware. hence jpeg is considerably more appropriate than gif for use as a usenet posting standard. [3] when should i use jpeg, and when should i stick with gif? jpeg is *not* going to displace gif entirely; for some types of images, gif is superior in image quality, file size, or both. one of the first things to learn about jpeg is which kinds of images to apply it to. as a rule of thumb, jpeg is superior to gif for storing full-color or gray-scale images of \"realistic\" scenes; that means scanned photographs and similar material. jpeg is superior even if you don't have 24-bit display hardware, and it is a lot superior if you do. (see section 7 for details.) gif does significantly better on images with only a few distinct colors, such as cartoons and line drawings. in particular, large areas of pixels that are all *exactly* the same color are compressed very efficiently indeed by gif. jpeg can't squeeze these files as much as gif does without introducing visible defects. this sort of image is best kept in gif form. (in particular, single-color borders are quite cheap in gif files, but they should be avoided in jpeg files.) jpeg also has a hard time with very sharp edges: a row of pure-black pixels adjacent to a row of pure-white pixels, for example. sharp edges tend to come out blurred unless you use a very high quality setting. again, this sort of thing is not found in scanned photographs, but it shows up fairly often in gif files: borders, overlaid text, etc. the blurriness is particularly objectionable with text that's only a few pixels high. if you have a gif with a lot of small-size overlaid text, don't jpeg it. computer-drawn images (ray-traced scenes, for instance) usually fall between scanned images and cartoons in terms of complexity. the more complex and subtly rendered the image, the more likely that jpeg will do well on it. the same goes for semi-realistic artwork (fantasy drawings and such). plain black-and-white (two level) images should never be converted to jpeg. you need at least about 16 gray levels before jpeg is useful for gray-scale images. it should also be noted that gif is lossless for gray-scale images of up to 256 levels, while jpeg is not. if you have an existing library of gif images, you may wonder whether you should convert them to jpeg. you will lose a little image quality if you do. (section 7, which argues that jpeg image quality is superior to gif, only applies if both formats start from a full-color original. if you start from a gif, you've already irretrievably lost a great deal of information; jpeg can only make things worse.) however, the disk space savings may justify converting anyway. this is a decision you'll have to make for yourself. if you do convert a gif library to jpeg, see section 14 for hints. be prepared to leave some images in gif format, since some gifs will not convert well. [4] how well does jpeg compress images? pretty darn well. here are some sample file sizes for an image i have handy, a 727x525 full-color image of a ship in a harbor. the first three files are for comparison purposes; the rest were created with the free jpeg software described in section 6b. file size in bytes comments ship.ppm 1145040 original file in ppm format (no compression; 24 bits or 3 bytes per pixel, plus a few bytes overhead) ship.ppm.z 963829 ppm file passed through unix compress compress doesn't accomplish a lot, you'll note. other text-oriented compressors give similar results. ship.gif 240438 converted to gif with ppmquant -fs 256 | ppmtogif most of the savings is the result of losing color info: gif saves 8 bits/pixel, not 24. (see sec. 7.) ship.jpg95 155622 cjpeg -q 95 (highest useful quality setting) this is indistinguishable from the 24-bit original, at least to my nonprofessional eyeballs. ship.jpg75 58009 cjpeg -q 75 (default setting) you have to look mighty darn close to distinguish this from the original, even with both on-screen at once. ship.jpg50 38406 cjpeg -q 50 this has slight defects; if you know what to look for, you could tell it's been jpeged without seeing the original. still as good image quality as many recent postings in usenet pictures groups. ship.jpg25 25192 cjpeg -q 25 jpeg's characteristic \"blockiness\" becomes apparent at this setting (djpeg -blocksmooth helps some). still, i've seen plenty of usenet postings that were of poorer image quality than this. ship.jpg5o 6587 cjpeg -q 5 -optimize (-optimize cuts table overhead) blocky, but perfectly satisfactory for preview or indexing purposes. note that this file is tiny: the compression ratio from the original is 173:1 ! in this case jpeg can make a file that's a factor of four or five smaller than a gif of comparable quality (the -q 75 file is every bit as good as the gif, better if you have a full-color display). this seems to be a typical ratio for real-world scenes. [5] what are good \"quality\" settings for jpeg? most jpeg compressors let you pick a file size vs. image quality tradeoff by selecting a quality setting. there seems to be widespread confusion about the meaning of these settings. \"quality 95\" does not mean \"keep 95% of the information\", as some have claimed. the quality scale is purely arbitrary; it's not a percentage of anything. the name of the game in using jpeg is to pick the lowest quality setting (smallest file size) that decompresses into an image indistinguishable from the original. this setting will vary from one image to another and from one observer to another, but here are some rules of thumb. the default quality setting (-q 75) is very often the best choice. this setting is about the lowest you can go without expecting to see defects in a typical image. try -q 75 first; if you see defects, then go up. except for experimental purposes, never go above -q 95; saying -q 100 will produce a file two or three times as large as -q 95, but of hardly any better quality. if the image was less than perfect quality to begin with, you might be able to go down to -q 50 without objectionable degradation. on the other hand, you might need to go to a higher quality setting to avoid further degradation. the second case seems to apply much of the time when converting gifs to jpeg. the default -q 75 is about right for compressing 24-bit images, but -q 85 to 95 is usually better for converting gifs (see section 14 for more info). if you want a very small file (say for preview or indexing purposes) and are prepared to tolerate large defects, a -q setting in the range of 5 to 10 is about right. -q 2 or so may be amusing as \"op art\". (note: the quality settings discussed in this article apply to the free jpeg software described in section 6b, and to many programs based on it. other jpeg implementations, such as image alchemy, may use a completely different quality scale. some programs don't even provide a numeric scale, just \"high\"/\"medium\"/\"low\"-style choices.) [6] where can i get jpeg software? most of the programs described in this section are available by ftp. if you don't know how to use ftp, see the faq article \"how to find sources\". (if you don't have direct access to ftp, read about ftpmail servers in the same article.) that article appears regularly in news.answers, or you can get it by sending e-mail to mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu with \"send usenet/news.answers/finding-sources\" in the body. the \"anonymous ftp list faq\" may also be helpful --- it's usenet/news.answers/ftp-list/faq in the news.answers archive. note: this list changes constantly. if you have a copy more than a couple months old, get the latest jpeg faq from the news.answers archive. [6a] if you are looking for \"canned\" software, viewers, etc: the first part of this list is system-specific programs that only run on one kind of system. if you don't see what you want for your machine, check out the portable jpeg software described at the end of the list. note that this list concentrates on free and shareware programs that you can obtain over internet; but some commercial programs are listed too. x windows: xv (shareware, $25) is an excellent viewer for jpeg, gif, and many other image formats. it can also do format conversion and some simple image manipulations. it's available for ftp from export.lcs.mit.edu (18.24.0.12), file contrib/xv-3.00.tar.z. version 3.00 is a major upgrade with support for 24-bit displays and many other improvements; however, it is brand new and still has some bugs lurking. if you prefer not to be on the bleeding edge, stick with version 2.21, also available from export. note that version 2.21 is not a good choice if you have a 24-bit display (you'll get only 8-bit color), nor for converting 24-bit images to jpeg. but 2.21 works fine for converting gif and other 8-bit images to jpeg. caution: there is a glitch in version 2.21: be sure to check the \"save at normal size\" checkbox when saving a jpeg file, or the file will be blurry. another good choice for x windows is john cristy's free imagemagick package, also available from export.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/imagemagick.tar.z. this package handles many image processing and conversion tasks. the imagemagick viewer handles 24-bit displays correctly; for colormapped displays, it does better (though slower) color quantization than xv or the basic free jpeg software. both of the above are large, complex packages. if you just want a simple image viewer, try xloadimage or xli. xloadimage supports jpeg in its latest release, 3.03. xloadimage is free and available from export.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/xloadimage-3.03.tar.z. xli is a variant version of xloadimage, said by its fans to be somewhat faster and more robust than the original. (the current xli is indeed faster and more robust than the current xloadimage, at least with respect to jpeg files, because it has the ijg v4 decoder while xloadimage 3.03 is using a hacked-over v1. the next xloadimage release will fix this.) xli is also free and available from export.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/xli.1.14.tar.z. both programs are said to do the right thing with 24-bit displays. ms-dos: this covers plain dos; for windows or os/2 programs, see the next headings. one good choice is eric praetzel's free dvpeg, which views jpeg and gif files. the current version, 2.5, is available by ftp from sunee.uwaterloo.ca (129.97.50.50), file pub/jpeg/viewers/dvpeg25.zip. this is a good basic viewer that works on either 286 or 386/486 machines. the user interface is not flashy, but it's functional. another freeware jpeg/gif/tga viewer is mohammad rezaei's hiview. the current version, 1.2, is available from simtel20 and mirror sites (see note below), file msdos/graphics/hv12.zip. hiview requires a 386 or better cpu and a vcpi-compatible memory manager (qemm386 and 386max work; windows and os/2 do not). hiview is currently the fastest viewer for images that are no bigger than your screen. for larger images, it scales the image down to fit on the screen (rather than using panning/scrolling as most viewers do). you may or may not prefer this approach, but there's no denying that it slows down loading of large images considerably. note: installation is a bit tricky; read the directions carefully! a shareware alternative is colorview for dos ($30). this is easier to install than either of the two freeware alternatives. its user interface is also much spiffier-looking, although personally i find it harder to use --- more keystrokes, inconsistent behavior. it is faster than dvpeg but a little slower than hiview, at least on my hardware. (for images larger than screen size, dvpeg and colorview seem to be about the same speed, and both are faster than hiview.) the current version is 2.1, available from simtel20 and mirror sites (see note below), file msdos/graphics/dcview21.zip. requires a vesa graphics driver; if you don't have one, look in vesadrv2.zip or vesa-tsr.zip from the same directory. (many recent pcs have a built-in vesa driver, so don't try to load a vesa driver unless colorview complains that the driver is missing.) a second shareware alternative is fullview, which has been kicking around the net for a while, but i don't know any stable archive location for it. the current (rather old) version is inferior to the above viewers anyway. the author tells me that a new version of fullview will be out shortly and it will be submitted to the simtel20 archives at that time. the well-known gif viewer compushow (cshow) supports jpeg in its latest revision, 8.60a. however, cshow's jpeg implementation isn't very good: it's slow (about half the speed of the above viewers) and image quality is poor except on hi-color displays. too bad ... it'd have been nice to see a good jpeg capability in cshow. shareware, $25. available from simtel20 and mirror sites (see note below), file msdos/gif/cshw860a.zip. due to the remarkable variety of pc graphics hardware, any one of these viewers might not work on your particular machine. if you can't get *any* of them to work, you'll need to use one of the following conversion programs to convert jpeg to gif, then view with your favorite gif viewer. (if you have hi-color hardware, don't use gif as the intermediate format; try to find a targa-capable viewer instead. vpic5.0 is reputed to do the right thing with hi-color displays.) the independent jpeg group's free jpeg converters are ftpable from simtel20 and mirror sites (see note below), file msdos/graphics/jpeg4.zip (or jpeg4386.zip if you have a 386 and extended memory). these files are dos compilations of the free source code described in section 6b; they will convert jpeg to and from gif, targa, and ppm formats. handmade software offers free jpeg<=>gif conversion tools, gif2jpg/jpg2gif. these are slow and are limited to conversion to and from gif format; in particular, you can't get 24-bit color output from a jpeg. the major advantage of these tools is that they will read and write hsi's proprietary jpeg format as well as the usenet-standard jfif format. since hsi-format files are rather widespread on bbses, this is a useful capability. version 2.0 of these tools is free (prior versions were shareware). get it from simtel20 and mirror sites (see note below), file msdos/graphics/gif2jpg2.zip. note: do not use hsi format for files to be posted on internet, since it is not readable on non-pc platforms. handmade software also has a shareware image conversion and manipulation package, image alchemy. this will translate jpeg files (both jfif and hsi formats) to and from many other image formats. it can also display images. a demo version of image alchemy version 1.6.2 is available from simtel20 and mirror sites (see note below), file msdos/graphics/alch162.zip. note about simtel20: the internet's key archive site for pc-related programs is simtel20, full name wsmr-simtel20.army.mil (192.88.110.20). simtel20 runs a non-unix system with weird directory names; where this document refers to directory (eg) \"msdos/graphics\" at simtel20, that really means \"pd1:<msdos.graphics>\". if you are not physically on milnet, you should expect rather slow ftp transfer rates from simtel20. there are several internet sites that maintain copies (mirrors) of the simtel20 archives; most ftp users should go to one of the mirror sites instead. a popular usa mirror site is oak.oakland.edu (141.210.10.117), which keeps simtel20 files in (eg) \"/pub/msdos/graphics\". if you have no ftp capability, you can retrieve files from simtel20 by e-mail; see informational postings in comp.archives.msdos.announce to find out how. if you are outside the usa, consult the same newsgroup to learn where your nearest simtel20 mirror is. microsoft windows: there are several windows programs capable of displaying jpeg images. (windows viewers are generally slower than dos viewers on the same hardware, due to windows' system overhead. note that you can run the dos conversion programs described above inside a windows dos window.) the newest entry is winecj, which is free and extremely fast. version 1.0 is available from ftp.rahul.net, file /pub/bryanw/pc/jpeg/wecj.zip. requires windows 3.1 and 256-or-more-colors mode. this is a no-frills viewer with the bad habit of hogging the machine completely while it decodes; and the image quality is noticeably worse than other viewers. but it's so fast you'll use it anyway, at least for previewing... jview is freeware, fairly fast, has good on-line help, and can write out the decompressed image in windows bmp format; but it can't create new jpeg files, and it doesn't view gifs. jview also lacks some other useful features of the shareware viewers (such as brightness adjustment), but it's an excellent basic viewer. the current version, 0.9, is available from ftp.cica.indiana.edu (129.79.20.84), file pub/pc/win3/desktop/jview090.zip. (mirrors of this archive can be found at some other internet sites, including wuarchive.wustl.edu.) winjpeg (shareware, $20) displays jpeg,gif,targa,tiff, and bmp image files; it can write all of these formats too, so it can be used as a converter. it has some other nifty features including color-balance adjustment and slideshow. the current version is 2.1, available from simtel20 and mirror sites (see note above), file msdos/windows3/winjp210.zip. (this is a slow 286-compatible version; if you register, you'll get the 386-only version, which is roughly 25% faster.) colorview is another shareware entry ($30). this was an early and promising contender, but it has not been updated in some time, and at this point it has no real advantages over winjpeg. if you want to try it anyway, the current version is 0.97, available from ftp.cica.indiana.edu, file pub/pc/win3/desktop/cview097.zip. (i understand that a new version will be appearing once the authors are finished with colorview for dos.) dvpeg (see dos heading) also works under windows, but only in full-screen mode, not in a window. os/2: the following files are available from hobbes.nmsu.edu (128.123.35.151). note: check /pub/uploads for more recent versions --- the hobbes moderator is not very fast about moving uploads into their permanent directories. /pub/os2/2.x/graphics/jpegv4.zip 32-bit version of free ijg conversion programs, version 4. /pub/os2/all/graphics/jpeg4-16.zip 16-bit version of same, for os/2 1.x. /pub/os2/2.x/graphics/imgarc12.zip image archiver 1.02: image conversion/viewing with pm graphical interface. strong on conversion functions, viewing is a bit weaker. shareware, $15. /pub/os2/2.x/graphics/pmjpeg11.zip pmjpeg 1.1: os/2 2.x port of winjpeg, a popular viewer for windows (see description in windows section). shareware, $20. /pub/os2/2.x/graphics/pmview85.zip pmview 0.85: jpeg/gif/bmp/targa/pcx viewer. gif viewing very fast, jpeg viewing roughly the same speed as the above two programs. has image manipulation & slideshow functions. shareware, $20. macintosh: most mac jpeg programs rely on apple's jpeg implementation, which is part of the quicktime system extension; so you need to have quicktime installed. to use quicktime, you need a 68020 or better cpu and you need to be running system 6.0.7 or later. (if you're running system 6, you must also install the 32-bit quickdraw extension; this is built-in on system 7.) you can get quicktime by ftp from ftp.apple.com, file dts/mac/quicktime/quicktime.hqx. (as of 11/92, this file contains quicktime 1.5, which is better than qt 1.0 in several ways. with respect to jpeg, it is marginally faster and considerably less prone to crash when fed a corrupt jpeg file. however, some applications seem to have compatibility problems with qt 1.5.) mac users should keep in mind that quicktime's jpeg format, pict/jpeg, is not the same as the usenet-standard jfif jpeg format. (see section 10 for details.) if you post images on usenet, make sure they are in jfif format. most of the programs mentioned below can generate either format. the first choice is probably jpegview, a free program for viewing images that are in jfif format, pict/jpeg format, or gif format. it also can convert between the two jpeg formats. the current version, 2.0, is a big improvement over prior versions. get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu (36.44.0.6), file /info-mac/app/jpeg-view-20.hqx. requires system 7 and quicktime. on 8-bit displays, jpegview usually produces the best color image quality of all the currently available mac jpeg viewers. jpegview can view large images in much less memory than other mac viewers; in fact, it's the only one that can deal with jpeg images much over 640x480 pixels on a typical 4mb mac. given a large image, jpegview automatically scales it down to fit on the screen, rather than presenting scroll bars like most other viewers. (you can zoom in on any desired portion, though.) some people like this behavior, some don't. overall, jpegview's user interface is very well thought out. gifconverter, a shareware ($40) image viewer/converter, supports jfif and pict/jpeg, as well as gif and several other image formats. the latest version is 2.3.2. get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file /info-mac/art/gif/gif-converter-232.hqx. requires system 6.0.5 or later. gifconverter is not better than jpegview as a plain jpeg/gif viewer, but it has much more extensive image manipulation and format conversion capabilities, so you may find it worth its shareware fee if you do a lot of playing around with images. also, the newest version of gifconverter can load and save jfif images *without* quicktime, so it is your best bet if your machine is too old to run quicktime. (but it's faster with quicktime.) note: if gifconverter runs out of memory trying to load a large jpeg, try converting the file to gif with jpeg convert, then viewing the gif version. jpeg convert, a mac version of the free ijg jpeg conversion utilities, is available from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file /info-mac/app/jpeg-convert-10.hqx. this will run on any mac, but it only does file conversion, not viewing. you can use it in conjunction with any gif viewer. previous versions of this faq recommended imagery jpeg v0.6, a jpeg<=>gif converter based on an old version of the ijg code. if you are using this program, you definitely should replace it with jpeg convert. apple's free program pictpixie can view images in jfif, quicktime jpeg, and gif format, and can convert between these formats. you can get pictpixie from ftp.apple.com, file dts/mac/quicktime/qt.1.0.stuff/pictpixie.hqx. requires quicktime. pictpixie was intended as a developer's tool, and it's really not the best choice unless you like to fool around with quicktime. some of its drawbacks are that it requires lots of memory, it produces relatively poor color image quality on anything less than a 24-bit display, and it has a relatively unfriendly user interface. worse, pictpixie is an unsupported program, meaning it has some minor bugs that apple does not intend to fix. (there is an old version of pictpixie, called pictcompressor, floating around the net. if you have this you should trash it, as it's even buggier. also, the quicktime starter kit includes a much cleaned-up descendant of pictpixie called picture compressor. note that picture compressor is not free and may not be distributed on the net.) storm technology's picture decompress is a free jpeg viewer/converter. this rather old program is inferior to the above programs in many ways, but it will run without system 7 or quicktime, so you may be forced to use it on older systems. (it does need 32-bit quickdraw, so really old machines can't use it.) you can get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file /info-mac/app/picture-decompress-201.hqx. you must set the file type of a downloaded image file to 'jpeg' to allow picture decompress to open it. if your machine is too old to run 32-bit quickdraw (a mac plus for instance), gifconverter is your only choice for single-program jpeg viewing. if you don't want to pay for gifconverter, use jpeg convert and a free gif viewer. more and more commercial mac applications are supporting jpeg, although not all can deal with the usenet-standard jfif format. adobe photoshop, version 2.0.1 or later, can read and write jfif-format jpeg files (use the jpeg plug-in from the acquire menu). you must set the file type of a downloaded jpeg file to 'jpeg' to allow photoshop to recognize it. amiga: (most programs listed in this section are stored in the aminet archive at amiga.physik.unizh.ch (130.60.80.80). there are many mirror sites of this archive and you should try to use the closest one. in the usa, a good choice is wuarchive.wustl.edu; look under /mirrors/amiga.physik.unizh.ch/...) hamlab plus is an excellent jpeg viewer/converter, as well as being a general image manipulation tool. it's cheap (shareware, $20) and can read several formats besides jpeg. the current version is 2.0.8. a demo version is available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), file amiga/gfx/edit/hamlab208d.lha. the demo version will crop images larger than 512x512, but it is otherwise fully functional. rend24 (shareware, $30) is an image renderer that can display jpeg, ilbm, and gif images. the program can be used to create animations, even capturing frames on-the-fly from rendering packages like lightwave. the current version is 1.05, available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), file amiga/os30/gfx/rend105.lha. (note: although this directory is supposedly for amigados 3.0 programs, the program will also run under amigados 1.3, 2.04 or 2.1.) viewtek is a free jpeg/ilbm/gif/anim viewer. the current version is 1.04, available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), file amiga/gfx/show/viewtek104.lha. if you're willing to spend real money, there are several commercial packages that support jpeg. two are written by thomas krehbiel, the author of rend24 and viewtek. these are cinemorph, a standalone image morphing package, and imagefx, an impressive 24-bit image capture, conversion, editing, painting, effects and prepress package that also includes cinemorph. both are distributed by great valley products. art department professional (adpro), from asdg inc, is the most widely used commercial image manipulation software for amigas. imagemaster, from black belt systems, is another well-regarded commercial graphics package with jpeg support. the free ijg jpeg software is available compiled for amigas from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites) in directory amiga/gfx/conv, file amigajpegv4.lha. these programs convert jpeg to/from ppm,gif,targa formats. the amiga world is heavily infested with quick-and-dirty jpeg programs, many based on an ancient beta-test version of the free ijg jpeg software (thanks to a certain magazine that published same on its disk-of-the-month, without so much as notifying the authors). among these are \"augjpeg\", \"newamyjpeg\", \"vjpeg\", and probably others i have not even heard of. in my opinion, anything older than ijg version 3 (march 1992) is not worth the disk space it's stored on; if you have such a program, trash it and get something newer. atari st: the free ijg jpeg software is available compiled for atari st, tt, etc, from atari.archive.umich.edu, file /atari/graphics/jpeg4bin.zoo. these programs convert jpeg to/from ppm, gif, targa formats. for monochrome st monitors, try mgif, which manages to achieve four-level grayscale effect by flickering. version 4.1 reads jpeg files. available from atari.archive.umich.edu, file /atari/graphics/mgif41b.zoo. i have not heard of any other free or shareware jpeg-capable viewers for ataris, but surely there must be some by now? pointers appreciated. acorn archimedes: !changefsi, supplied with risc os 3 version 3.10, can convert from and view jpeg jfif format. provision is also made to convert images to jpeg, although this must be done from the cli rather than by double-clicking. recent versions (since 7.11) of the shareware program translator can handle jpeg, along with about 30 other image formats. while older versions can be found on some archimedes bboards, the current version is only available by registering with the author, john kortink, nutterbrink 31, 7544 wj, enschede, the netherlands. price 35 dutch guilders (about $22 or 10 pounds). there's also a commercial product called !jpeg which provides jpeg read/write functionality and direct jpeg viewing, as well as a host of other image format conversion and processing options. this is more expensive but not necessarily better than the above programs. contact: dt software, freepost, cambridge, uk. tel: 0223 841099. next: imageviewer is a pd utility that displays images and can do some format conversions. the current version reads jpeg but does not write it. imageviewer is available from the standard next archives at sonata.cc.purdue.edu and cs.orst.edu, somewhere in /pub/next (both are currently being re-organized, so it's hard to point to specific sub-directories). note that there is an older version floating around that does not support jpeg. portable software for almost any system: if none of the above fits your situation, you can obtain and compile the free jpeg conversion software described in 6b. you'll also need a viewer program. if your display is 8 bits or less, any gif viewer will do fine; if you have a display with more color capability, try to find a viewer that can read targa or ppm 24-bit image files. there are numerous commercial jpeg offerings, with more popping up every day. i recommend that you not spend money on one of these unless you find the available free or shareware software vastly too slow. in that case, purchase a hardware-assisted product. ask pointed questions about whether the product complies with the final jpeg standard and about whether it can handle the jfif file format; many of the earliest commercial releases are not and never will be compatible with anyone else's files. [6b] if you are looking for source code to work with: free, portable c code for jpeg compression is available from the independent jpeg group, which i lead. a package containing our source code, documentation, and some small test files is available from several places. the \"official\" archive site for this source code is ftp.uu.net (137.39.1.9 or 192.48.96.9). look under directory /graphics/jpeg; the current release is jpegsrc.v4.tar.z. (this is a compressed tar file; don't forget to retrieve in binary mode.) you can retrieve this file by ftp or uucp. if you are on a pc and don't know how to cope with .tar.z format, you may prefer zip format, which you can find at simtel20 and mirror sites (see note above), file msdos/graphics/jpegsrc4.zip. this file will also be available on compuserve, in the graphsupport forum (go pics), library 15, as jpsrc4.zip. if you have no ftp access, you can retrieve the source from your nearest comp.sources.misc archive; version 4 appeared as issues 55-72 of volume 34. (if you don't know how to retrieve comp.sources.misc postings, see the faq article \"how to find sources\", referred to at the top of section 6.) the free jpeg code provides conversion between jpeg \"jfif\" format and image files in gif, pbmplus ppm/pgm, utah rle, and truevision targa file formats. the core compression and decompression modules can easily be reused in other programs, such as image viewers. the package is highly portable; we have tested it on many machines ranging from pcs to crays. we have released this software for both noncommercial and commercial use. companies are welcome to use it as the basis for jpeg-related products. we do not ask a royalty, although we do ask for an acknowledgement in product literature (see the readme file in the distribution for details). we hope to make this software industrial-quality --- although, as with anything that's free, we offer no warranty and accept no liability. the independent jpeg group is a volunteer organization; if you'd like to contribute to improving our software, you are welcome to join. [7] what's all this hoopla about color quantization? most people don't have full-color (24 bit per pixel) display hardware. typical display hardware stores 8 or fewer bits per pixel, so it can display 256 or fewer distinct colors at a time. to display a full-color image, the computer must map the image into an appropriate set of representative colors. this process is called \"color quantization\". (this is something of a misnomer, \"color selection\" would be a better term. we're stuck with the standard usage though.) clearly, color quantization is a lossy process. it turns out that for most images, the details of the color quantization algorithm have much more impact on the final image quality than do any errors introduced by jpeg (except at the very lowest jpeg quality settings). since jpeg is a full-color format, converting a color jpeg image for display on 8-bit-or-less hardware requires color quantization. this is true for *all* color jpegs: even if you feed a 256-or-less-color gif into jpeg, what comes out of the decompressor is *not* 256 colors, but thousands of colors. this happens because jpeg's lossiness affects each pixel a little differently, so two pixels that started with identical colors will probably come out with slightly different colors. each original color gets \"smeared\" into a group of nearby colors. therefore quantization is always required to display a color jpeg on a colormapped display, regardless of the image source. the only way to avoid quantization is to ask for gray-scale output. (incidentally, because of this effect it's nearly meaningless to talk about the number of colors used by a jpeg image. even if you attempted to count the number of distinct pixel values, different jpeg decoders would give you different results because of roundoff error differences. i occasionally see posted images described as \"256-color jpeg\". this tells me that the poster (a) hasn't read this faq and (b) probably converted the jpeg from a gif. jpegs can be classified as color or gray-scale (just like photographs), but number of colors just isn't a useful concept for jpeg.) on the other hand, a gif image by definition has already been quantized to 256 or fewer colors. (a gif *does* have a definite number of colors in its palette, and the format doesn't allow more than 256 palette entries.) for purposes of usenet picture distribution, gif has the advantage that the sender precomputes the color quantization, so recipients don't have to. this is also the *disadvantage* of gif: you're stuck with the sender's quantization. if the sender quantized to a different number of colors than what you can display, you have to re-quantize, resulting in much poorer image quality than if you had quantized once from a full-color image. furthermore, if the sender didn't use a high-quality color quantization algorithm, you're out of luck. for this reason, jpeg offers the promise of significantly better image quality for all users whose machines don't match the sender's display hardware. jpeg's full color image can be quantized to precisely match the user's display hardware. furthermore, you will be able to take advantage of future improvements in quantization algorithms (there is a lot of active research in this area), or purchase better display hardware, to get a better view of jpeg images you already have. with a gif, you're stuck forevermore with what was sent. it's also worth mentioning that many gif-viewing programs include rather shoddy quantization routines. if you view a 256-color gif on a 16-color ega display, for example, you are probably getting a much worse image than you need to. this is partly an inevitable consequence of doing two color quantizations (one to create the gif, one to display it), but often it's also due to sloppiness. jpeg conversion programs will be forced to use high quality quantizers in order to get acceptable results at all, and in normal use they will quantize directly to the number of colors to be displayed. thus, jpeg is likely to provide better results than the average gif program for low-color-resolution displays as well as high-resolution ones! finally, an ever-growing number of people have better-than-8-bit display hardware already: 15-bit \"hi-color\" pc displays, true 24-bit displays on workstations and macintoshes, etc. for these people, gif is already obsolete, as it cannot represent an image to the full capabilities of their display. jpeg images can drive these displays much more effectively. thus, jpeg is an all-around better choice than gif for representing images in a machine-independent fashion. [8] how does jpeg work? the buzz-words to know are chrominance subsampling, discrete cosine transforms, coefficient quantization, and huffman or arithmetic entropy coding. this article's long enough already, so i'm not going to say more than that here. for technical information, see the comp.compression faq. this is available from the news.answers archive at rtfm.mit.edu, in files /pub/usenet/news.answers/compression-faq/part[1-3]. if you need help in using the news.answers archive, see the top of this article. [9] what about lossless jpeg? there's a great deal of confusion on this subject. the jpeg committee did define a truly lossless compression algorithm, i.e., one that guarantees the final output is bit-for-bit identical to the original input. however, this lossless mode has almost nothing in common with the regular, lossy jpeg algorithm, and it offers much less compression. at present, very few implementations of lossless jpeg exist, and all of them are commercial. saying \"-q 100\" to the free jpeg software does not get you a lossless image. what it does get rid of is deliberate information loss in the coefficient quantization step. there is still a good deal of information loss in the color subsampling step. (with the v4 free jpeg code, you can also say \"-sample 1x1\" to turn off subsampling. keep in mind that many commercial jpeg implementations cannot cope with the resulting file.) even with both quantization and subsampling turned off, the regular jpeg algorithm is not lossless, because it is subject to roundoff errors in various calculations. the maximum error is a few counts in any one pixel value; it's highly unlikely that this could be perceived by the human eye, but it might be a concern if you are doing machine processing of an image. at this minimum-loss setting, regular jpeg produces files that are perhaps half the size of an uncompressed 24-bit-per-pixel image. true lossless jpeg provides roughly the same amount of compression, but it guarantees bit-for-bit accuracy. if you have an application requiring lossless storage of images with less than 6 bits per pixel (per color component), you may want to look into the jbig bilevel image compression standard. this performs better than jpeg lossless on such images. jpeg lossless is superior to jbig on images with 6 or more bits per pixel; furthermore, jpeg is public domain (at least with a huffman back end), while the jbig techniques are heavily covered by patents. [10] why all the argument about file formats? strictly speaking, jpeg refers only to a family of compression algorithms; it does *not* refer to a specific image file format. the jpeg committee was prevented from defining a file format by turf wars within the international standards organizations. since we can't actually exchange images with anyone else unless we agree on a common file format, this leaves us with a problem. in the absence of official standards, a number of jpeg program writers have just gone off to \"do their own thing\", and as a result their programs aren't compatible with anybody else's. the closest thing we have to a de-facto standard jpeg format is some work that's been coordinated by people at c-cube microsystems. they have defined two jpeg-based file formats: * jfif (jpeg file interchange format), a \"low-end\" format that transports pixels and not much else. * tiff/jpeg, aka tiff 6.0, an extension of the aldus tiff format. tiff is a \"high-end\" format that will let you record just about everything you ever wanted to know about an image, and a lot more besides :-). tiff is a lot more complex than jfif, and may well prove less transportable, because different vendors have historically implemented slightly different and incompatible subsets of tiff. it's not likely that adding jpeg to the mix will do anything to improve this situation. both of these formats were developed with input from all the major vendors of jpeg-related products; it's reasonably likely that future commercial products will adhere to one or both standards. i believe that usenet should adopt jfif as the replacement for gif in picture postings. jfif is simpler than tiff and is available now; the tiff 6.0 spec has only recently been officially adopted, and it is still unusably vague on some crucial details. even when tiff/jpeg is well defined, the jfif format is likely to be a widely supported \"lowest common denominator\"; tiff/jpeg files may never be as transportable. a particular case that people may be interested in is apple's quicktime software for the macintosh. quicktime uses a jfif-compatible format wrapped inside the mac-specific pict structure. conversion between jfif and quicktime jpeg is pretty straightforward, and several mac programs are available to do it (see mac portion of section 6a). if you have an editor that handles binary files, you can strip a quicktime jpeg pict down to jfif by hand; see section 11 for details. another particular case is handmade software's programs (gif2jpg/jpg2gif and image alchemy). these programs are capable of reading and writing jfif format. by default, though, they write a proprietary format developed by hsi. this format is not readable by any non-hsi programs and should not be used for usenet postings. use the -j switch to get jfif output. (this applies to old versions of these programs; the current releases emit jfif format by default. you still should be careful not to post hsi-format files, unless you want to get flamed by people on non-pc platforms.) [11] how do i recognize which file format i have, and what do i do about it? if you have an alleged jpeg file that your software won't read, it's likely to be hsi format or some other proprietary jpeg-based format. you can tell what you have by inspecting the first few bytes of the file: 1. a jfif-standard file will start with the characters (hex) ff d8 ff e0, followed by two variable bytes (often hex 00 10), followed by 'jfif'. 2. if you see ff d8 at the start, but not the rest of it, you may have a \"raw jpeg\" file. this is probably decodable as-is by jfif software --- it's worth a try, anyway. 3. hsi files start with 'hsi1'. you're out of luck unless you have hsi software. portions of the file may look like plain jpeg data, but they won't decompress properly with non-hsi programs. 4. a macintosh pict file, if jpeg-compressed, will have a couple hundred bytes of header followed by a jfif header (scan for 'jfif'). strip off everything before the ff d8 and you should be able to read it. 5. anything else: it's a proprietary format, or not jpeg at all. if you are lucky, the file may consist of a header and a raw jpeg data stream. if you can identify the start of the jpeg data stream (look for ff d8), try stripping off everything before that. in uuencoded usenet postings, the characteristic jfif pattern is \"begin\" line m_]c_x ... whereas uuencoded hsi files will start with \"begin\" line m:'-i ... if you learn to check for the former, you can save yourself the trouble of downloading non-jfif files. [12] what about arithmetic coding? the jpeg spec defines two different \"back end\" modules for the final output of compressed data: either huffman coding or arithmetic coding is allowed. the choice has no impact on image quality, but arithmetic coding usually produces a smaller compressed file. on typical images, arithmetic coding produces a file 5 or 10 percent smaller than huffman coding. (all the file-size numbers previously cited are for huffman coding.) unfortunately, the particular variant of arithmetic coding specified by the jpeg standard is subject to patents owned by ibm, at&t, and mitsubishi. thus *you cannot legally use arithmetic coding* unless you obtain licenses from these companies. (the \"fair use\" doctrine allows people to implement and test the algorithm, but actually storing any images with it is dubious at best.) at least in the short run, i recommend that people not worry about arithmetic coding; the space savings isn't great enough to justify the potential legal hassles. in particular, arithmetic coding *should not* be used for any images to be exchanged on usenet. there is some small chance that the legal situation may change in the future. stay tuned for further details. [13] does loss accumulate with repeated compression/decompression? it would be nice if, having compressed an image with jpeg, you could decompress it, manipulate it (crop off a border, say), and recompress it without any further image degradation beyond what you lost initially. unfortunately this is not the case. in general, recompressing an altered image loses more information, though usually not as much as was lost the first time around. the next best thing would be that if you decompress an image and recompress it *without changing it* then there is no further loss, i.e., you get an identical jpeg file. even this is not true; at least, not with the current free jpeg software. it's essentially a problem of accumulation of roundoff error. if you repeatedly compress and decompress, the image will eventually degrade to where you can see visible changes from the first-generation output. (it usually takes many such cycles to get visible change.) one of the things on our to-do list is to see if accumulation of error can be avoided or limited, but i am not optimistic about it. in any case, the most that could possibly be guaranteed would be that compressing the unmodified full-color output of djpeg, at the original quality setting, would introduce no further loss. even such simple changes as cropping off a border could cause further roundoff-error degradation. (if you're wondering why, it's because the pixel-block boundaries move. if you cropped off only multiples of 16 pixels, you might be safe, but that's a mighty limited capability!) the bottom line is that jpeg is a useful format for archival storage and transmission of images, but you don't want to use it as an intermediate format for sequences of image manipulation steps. use a lossless format (ppm, rle, tiff, etc) while working on the image, then jpeg it when you are ready to file it away. aside from avoiding degradation, you will save a lot of compression/decompression time this way :-). [14] what are some rules of thumb for converting gif images to jpeg? as stated earlier, you *will* lose some amount of image information if you convert an existing gif image to jpeg. if you can obtain the original full-color data the gif was made from, it's far better to make a jpeg from that. but if you need to save space and have only the gif to work from, here are some suggestions for getting maximum space savings with minimum loss of quality. the first rule when converting a gif library is to look at each jpeg, to make sure you are happy with it, before throwing away the corresponding gif; that will give you a chance to re-do the conversion with a higher quality setting if necessary. some gifs may be better left as gifs, as explained in section 3; in particular, cartoon-type gifs with sixteen or fewer colors don't convert well. you may find that a jpeg file of reasonable quality will be *larger* than the gif. (so check the sizes too.) experience to date suggests that large, high-visual-quality gifs are the best candidates for conversion to jpeg. they chew up the most storage so offer the most potential savings, and they convert to jpeg with least degradation. don't waste your time converting any gif much under 100 kbytes. also, don't expect jpeg files converted from gifs to be as small as those created directly from full-color originals. to maintain image quality you may have to let the converted files be as much as twice as big as straight-through jpeg files would be (i.e., shoot for 1/2 or 1/3rd the size of the gif file, not 1/4th as suggested in earlier comparisons). many people have developed an odd habit of putting a large constant-color border around a gif image. while useless, this was nearly free in terms of storage cost in gif files. it is not free in jpeg files, and the sharp border boundary can create visible artifacts (\"ghost\" edges). do yourself a favor and crop off any border before jpeging. (if you are on an x windows system, xv's manual and automatic cropping functions are a very painless way to do this.) cjpeg's default q setting of 75 is appropriate for full-color input, but for gif inputs, q settings of 85 to 95 often seem to be necessary to avoid image degradation. (if you apply smoothing as suggested below, the higher q setting may not be necessary.) color gifs of photographs or complex artwork are usually \"dithered\" to fool your eye into seeing more than the 256 colors that gif can actually store. if you enlarge the image, you will see that adjacent pixels are often of significantly different colors; at normal size the eye averages these pixels together to produce the illusion of an intermediate color value. the trouble with dithering is that, to jpeg, it looks like high-spatial-frequency color noise; and jpeg can't compress noise very well. the resulting jpeg file is both larger and of lower image quality than what you would have gotten from jpeging the original full color image (if you had it). to get around this, you want to \"smooth\" the gif image before compression. smoothing averages together nearby pixels, thus approximating the color that you thought you saw anyway, and in the process getting rid of the rapid color changes that give jpeg trouble. appropriate use of smoothing will often let you avoid using a high q factor, thus further reducing the size of the compressed file, while still obtaining a better-looking output image than you'd get without smoothing. with the v4 free jpeg software (or products based on it), a simple smoothing capability is built in. try \"-smooth 10\" or so when converting gifs. values of 10 to 25 seem to work well for high-quality gifs. heavy-handed dithering may require larger smoothing factors. (if you can see regular fine-scale patterns on the gif image even without enlargement, then strong smoothing is definitely called for.) too large a smoothing factor will blur the output image, which you don't want. if you are an image processing wizard, you can also do smoothing with a separate filtering program, such as pnmconvol from the pbmplus package. however, cjpeg's built-in smoother is a lot faster than pnmconvol... the upshot of all this is that \"cjpeg -quality 85 -smooth 10\" is probably a good starting point for converting gifs. but if you really care about the image, you'll want to check the results and maybe try a few other settings. --------------------- for more information about jpeg in general or the free jpeg software in particular, contact the independent jpeg group at jpeg-info@uunet.uu.net.",

            "if clipper comes to cellular phones along with legal proscriptions against using other cipher systems on these phones, a new and potentially dangerous class of crime is created. criminals who very badly want inscrutable tactical communications (specifically the terrorists and drug dealers who proponents of key escrow cite as threats) will be highly motivated to steal the cipher phone of a legitimate user, and to kill this person or hold them hostage so discovery of compromise of the device will be delayed. once a suitable collection of devices is stolen, criminals can communicate with impunity (assuming the cipher system carries no trapdoors apart from key escrow) until and unless the compromise is discovered by some other means. because life-is-cheap criminals are currently willing to kill people to steal very large and conspicuous property (luxury cars), it is reasonable to assume that they will be willing to kill people to steal small and inconspicuous property (a cipher cellular phone). just as we have seen in the past with \"blue box\" technology, and in the present with modified cellular phones, we can expect to see among high-stakes criminals a lucrative market for stolen cipher phones which can be used for a few days. the high-stakes criminals will pay the life-is-cheap types substantial amounts for stolen instruments. because a person is typically discovered as missing or dead in a few days, a stolen instrument will be usable for only a few days. there will be a continuing demand for fresh phones: fresh bodies. in other words, clipper and similar systems have the potential to turn a current inconvenience to law enforcement into a direct, vicious, and persistent threat to the general public. on the other hand, if a criminal were to apply some arbitrary cipher to a device in a mostly non-ciphered network, the communication will at least stand out as being unusual, and perhaps worthy of other means of investigation. finally, because there is essentially no possibility of intercepting in realtime the scrutable content of communications between stolen instruments, there will exist strong motivation to record and archive _all_ communications in the network for ex-post-facto scrutiny (once some criminal act is discovered, and the instruments involved have been identified). while recording and archiving may not be feasible for wireline networks, it is probably feasible across the more limited bandwidth of radio networks. the existence of these recordings could open up vast potential for abuse.",

(i can't speak authoritatively on this -- maybe somebody else has details.) then they started running a \"two million strong!\" campaign for a while -- but they let it slip into unannounced obscurity when it became clear that they simply were never going to reach that level of membership. in 1964, just after the commencement of the dodd hearings -- the starting point of the modern gun-control movement, the nra had a mere 625,000 members. by 1968, barely after the first murmurs of future registration, it had about a million. today, it has over three million members, making it the third largest membership organization in the country (next to aarp and aaa). and its membership is growing faster than at any previous time. (historical figures from kukla's \"gun control,\" pp. 61 and 420.) as you say, many of the people in the middle of this debate are bemused by their t-bones and mtv. that leaves hard-core gun-owners against hard-core gun banners. i know a number of ex-hci members who have recently become nra members. i've never heard of a single one who has gone the other way. yes, i think we can and will win this one. i think they would be used far less to hammer nails, as well, but, like you, i can't give any citation showing that this utilization is currently significant at more than an anecdotal level. if you can, i'm waiting. --",

there isn't any real evidence that this makes any big dent in crime anyway! all it does is make our privacy forfeit to the state!\" however, the wise man made the mistake of saying this, as the law required, in ruritanian, clearly and distinctly, and near a microphone. soon, the newly formed ruritanian secret police arrived and took him off, and got him to confess by torturing him. torture was, after all, far more efficient than the old methods, and had been recently instituted to stop the recent wave of people thinking obscene thoughts about tomatoes, which dorothy quisling noted was one of the major problems of the new age of plenty and joy. -- perry metzger pmetzger@shearson.com",

and the germans were subject to jewish genocide? are you for real? tell me 'halsall', were you high on \"asala/sdpa/arf\" forgeries and fabrications when you wrote that? where is your non-existent list of scholars. here is mine: during the first world war and the ensuing years - 1914-1920, the armenian dictatorship through a premeditated and systematic genocide, tried to complete its centuries-old policy of annihilation against the turks and kurds by savagely murdering 2.5 million muslims and deporting the rest from their 1,000 year homeland. the attempt at genocide is justly regarded as the first instance of genocide in the 20th century acted upon an entire people. this event is incontrovertibly proven by historians, government and international political leaders, such as u.s. ambassador mark bristol, william langer, ambassador layard, james barton, stanford shaw, arthur chester, john dewey, robert dunn, papazian, nalbandian, ohanus appressian, jorge blanco villalta, general nikolayef, general bolkovitinof, general prjevalski, general odiselidze, meguerditche, kazimir, motayef, twerdokhlebof, general hamelin, rawlinson, avetis aharonian, dr. stephan eshnanie, varandian, general bronsart, arfa, dr. hamlin, boghos nubar, sarkis atamian, katchaznouni, rachel bortnick, halide edip, mccarthy, w. b. allen, paul muratoff and many others. j. c. hurewitz, professor of government emeritus, former director of the middle east institute (1971-1984), columbia university. bernard lewis, cleveland e. dodge professor of near eastern history, princeton university. halil inalcik, university professor of ottoman history & member of the american academy of arts & sciences, university of chicago. peter golden, professor of history, rutgers university, newark. stanford shaw, professor of history, university of california at los angeles. thomas naff, professor of history & director, middle east research institute, university of pennsylvania. ronald jennings, associate professor of history & asian studies, university of illinois. howard reed, professor of history, university of connecticut. dankwart rustow, distinguished university professor of political science, city university graduate school, new york. john woods, associate professor of middle eastern history, university of chicago. john masson smith, jr., professor of history, university of california at berkeley. alan fisher, professor of history, michigan state university. avigdor levy, professor of history, brandeis university. andreas g. e. bodrogligetti, professor of history, university of california at los angeles. kathleen burrill, associate professor of turkish studies, columbia university. roderic davison, professor of history, george washington university. walter denny, professor of history, university of massachusetts. caesar farah, professor of history, university of minnesota. tom goodrich, professor of history, indiana university of pennsylvania. tibor halasi-kun, professor emeritus of turkish studies, columbia university. justin mccarthy, professor of history, university of louisville. jon mandaville, professor of history, portland state university (oregon). robert olson, professor of history, university of kentucky. madeline zilfi, professor of history, university of maryland. james stewart-robinson, professor of turkish studies, university of michigan. .......so the list goes on and on and on..... now wait, there is more. mark alan epstein, 'the ottoman jewish communities and their role in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries,' klaus schwarz werlag, freiburg (1980). page 19: <<during the fifteenth century, when the ottomans were struggling to reestablish themselves in the balkans, there was considerable turmoil among the jewish communities in central and western europe. even if the difficulties of the darker centuries immediately preceding the fourteenth are minimized, it is easy to understand the attraction which ottoman life, particularly when compared to life in europe, held for the jews. there is no way to tell how many jews left christendom for the realm of the rising muslim ottomans, but with each account of persecution in or expulsion from christian countries it is recorded that some jews fled to ottoman territory. the regularity of these reports suggests that the ottomans were considered reasonably tolerant protectors and that there was a regular trickle of jewish families moving southward and eastward from western and central europe. (...) it is evident that the effects of plague, late crusades, and the general intolerance and persecution of jews in christian europe resulted in the redirection of the whole focus of jewish life which, for more than two centuries, was to be oriented toward muslim east.>> page 21: <<in the second quarter of the fifteenth century the foremost official in the edirne jewish community was rabbi yitzhak sarfati the ashkenazi chief rabbi of the city. he was the most important rabbi in the city and the author of an important letter which tells us something of the situation of the edirne jewry in the fifteenth century. sarfati himself was from christian europe and supposedly wrote this letter at the behest of two recent arrivals from there, who, upon seeing the prosperity and freedom of the ottoman jews, prevailed upon him to write their european coreligionists apprising them of the situation and urging them to migrate. this remarkable letter advised its recipients not only of the pleasant conditions in the ottoman domains, but described as well the ease of travel to palestine and the holy places, an attraction to those who would make a pilgrimage or choose to be buried there.>> (*) page 41: <<...the impression gained from the hebrew sources is that the jews were firmly aware of the community of interests which existed between them and the ottomans, especially in comparison to relations with the christians of europe. confirmation of the commonality of interests between muslims and jews is also indicated by the fact that european christians perceived the jews as allies of islam and were well aware of muslim-jewish cooperation. certainly the activity of important jewish financiers and politicians representing the ottoman government abroad did not pass unnoticed. european sources are the basis for much of our knowledge of their careers. in addition it appears that christian pirates plundered ''turks and jews,'' their sworn enemies, and that europeans considered the jews to be agents who regularly reported to the ottomans. there are well-known examples of overt jewish support for the ottomans in the struggle against european powers. the two best known instances of jewish support for the campaigning ottomans are the frequently cited instances of the jewish contributions to the conquests of buda, in the early sixteenth century, and of rhodes. we also have reports of sympathy for the ottomans during the siege of chios. an unpublished ottoman document shows dramatically the mutual interests which existed in some greek towns...>> page 43: <<it is clear that throughout the sixteenth century it was a generally accepted fact that the interests of jews and muslims coincided frequently, and all parties involved, jews, muslims, and christians, were aware of the situation.>> page 46: <<...it seems that the relations between greeks and jews were not particularly cordial. the two groups had little in common, few common interests, and perceived no common philosophical or religious tradition which could serve as the basis for cooperation, rather than enmity. if there was any identifiable bond of good will which existed between religious communities in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, it was that between muslims and jews, neither of whom had much in common with the orthodox.>> page 46: <<the general impression of muslim-jewish relations in the ottoman context during the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries is one of community of interests. from the earliest times the ottomans seem to have welcomed jews to their territory and to have found in the communities already existing in places which they conquered a cooperative element. the jewish response to this tolerance was a steady flow of jews from christian countries to ottoman domains.>> page 151: <<from the period before 1453 we have only a few indications that the ottoman-jewish relationship was well on the course of amity which would characterize it for years afterward, but the liberality of the ottomans, in contrast to the intolerance of the byzantines, and the protection and the security which the ottomans offered, in comparison to conditions elsewhere, leave little doupt that even then both the ottomans and the jews recognized their mutual interests...>> page 161: <<it is impossible to say how fundamental the jews were in the success of the ottomans in rebuilding istanbul or in ottoman mercantile success in the sixteenth century. that they played an important role in both cannot be doupted. it is also unclear whether they were important enough to say that the ottomans would not have experienced their great success without the jews and that no other group could have been found to serve the ottomans as well as did the jews. it is, however, unmistakably clear that there are few parallels in world history to this remarkable partnership between jews and the non-jewish society in which they lived. we must conclude that the ottomans could probably not achieved their success without a group performing certain tasks for them as well as the jews did. certainly for the jews of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries the ottoman empire was a most remarkable and salubrious home.>> (*) a version of rabbi sarfati's [tzarfati] letter is given by prof.shaw: page 32: <<your cries and sobs reached us. we have been told of all the troubles and persecutions which you have to suffer in the german lands....i hear the lamentation of my brethren...the barbarous and cruel nation ruthlessly oppresses the faithful children of the chosen people...the priests and prelates of rome have risen. they wish to root out the memory of jacob and erase the name of israel. they always devise new persecutions. they wish to bring you to the stake...listen my brethren, to the counsel i will give you. i too was born in germany and studied torah with the german rabbis. i was driven out of my native country and came to the turkish land, which is blessed by god and filled with all good things. here i found rest and happiness; turkey can also become for you the land of peace...if you who live in germany knew even a tenth of what god has blessed us with in this land, you would not consider any difficulties; you would set out to come to us...here in the land of the turks we have nothing to complain of. we possess great fortunes; much gold and silver in our hands. we are not oppressed with heavy taxes, and our commerce is free and unhindered. rich are the fruits of the earth. everything is cheap, and every one of us lives in peace and freedom. here the jew is not compelled to wear a yellow hat as a badge of shame, as is the case in germany, where even wealth and great fortune are a curse for a jew because he therewith arouses jealousy among the christians and they devise all kinds of slander against him to rob him of his gold. arise my brethren, gird up your loins, collect your forces, and come to us. here you will be free of your enemies, here you will find rest...>>[13] [13] israel zinberg, a history of jewish literature. vol.v. the jewish center of culture in the ottoman empire (hebrew union college press,

            "[continuing with dr. deyoung's article-] survey of new interpretations of arsenokoitai d.s. bailey d.s. bailey was perhaps the trailblazer of new assessments of the meaning of arsenokoitai. he takes the term in i cor 6:9 as denoting males who actively engage in homosexual acts, in contrast to malakoi (\"effeminate\"), those who engage passively in such acts.*4 however, he insists that paul knew nothing of \"inversion as an inherited trait, or an inherent condition due to psychological or glandular causes, and consequently regards all homosexual practice as evidence of perversion\" (38). hence bailey limits the term's reference in paul's works to acts alone and laments modern translations of the term as \"homosexuals.\" bailey wants to distinguish between \"the homosexual *condition* (which is morally neutral) and homosexual *practices*\" [italics in source]. paul is precise in his terminology and moffatt's translation \"sodomites\" best represents paul's meaning in bailey's judgment (39). bailey clearly denies that the homosexual condition was known by biblical writers. j. boswell the most influential study of arsenokoitai among contemporary authors is that of john boswell.*5 whereas the usual translation*6 of this term gives it either explicitly or implicitly an active sense, boswell gives it a passive sense. in an extended discussion of the term (341-53), he cites \"linguistic evidence and common sense\" to support his conclusion that the word means \"male sexual agents, i.e. active male prostitutes.\" his argument is that the arseno- part of the word is adjectival, not the object of the koitai which refers to base sexual activity. hence the term, according to boswell, designates a male sexual person or male prostitute. he acknowledges, however, that most interpret the composite term as active, meaning \"those who sleep with, make their bed with, men.\" boswell bases his interpretation on linguistics and the historical setting. he argues that in some compounds, such as paidomathes (\"child learner\"), the paido- is the subject of manthano, and in others, such as paidoporos (\"through which a child passes\"), the paido- is neither subject nor object but simply a modifier without verbal significance. his point is that each compound must be individually analyzed for its meaning. more directly, he maintains that compounds with the attic form arreno- employ it objectively while those with the hellenistic arseno- use it as an adjective (343). yet he admits exceptions to this distinction regarding arreno-. boswell next appeals to the latin of the time, namely drauci or exoleti. these were male prostitutes having men or women as their objects. the greek arsenokoitai is the equivalent of the latin drauci; the corresponding passive would be parakoitai (\"one who lies beside\"), boswell affirms. he claims that arsenokoitai was the \"most explicit word available to paul for a male prostitute,\" since by paul's time the attic words pornos (\"fornicator\") and porneuon (\"one committing fornication\"), found also in the lxx, had been adopted \"to refer to men who resorted to female prostitutes or simply committed fornication.\"*7 in the absence of the term from pagan writers such as herodotus, plato, aristotle, and plutarch, and from the jewish writers philo and josephus, boswell finds even more convincing evidence for his affirmation that arsenokoitai \"did not connote 'homosexual' or even 'sodomite' in the time of paul\" (346).*8 he also demonstrates its absence in pseudo-lucian, sextus empiricus, and libanius. he subsequently finds it lacking in \"all discussions of homosexual relation\" (346)*9 among christian sources in greek, including the didache, tatian, justin martyr, eusebius,*10 clement of alexandria, gregory of nyssa, and john chrysostom. chrysostom is singled out for his omission as \"final proof\" that the word could not mean homosexuality.*11 boswell next appeals to the omission of the texts of i cor and i tim from discussions of homosexuality among latin church fathers (348).*12 cited are tertullian, arnobius, lactantius, and augustine. the last named uses \"circumlocutions.\" other latin writers include ausonius, cyprian, and minucius felix. the term is also lacking in state and in church legislation. by the sixth century the term became confused and was applied to a variety of sexual activities from child molesting to anal intercourse between a husband and wife (353). having surveyed the sources, boswell concludes, there is no reason to believe that either arsenokoitai or malakoi connoted homosexuality in the time of paul or for centuries thereafter, and every reason to suppose that, whatever they came to mean, they were not determinative of christian opinion on the morality of homosexual acts (353). it is clear throughout that boswell defines arsenokoitai to refer to male prostitutes. he even goes so far as to conclude that paul would probably not disapprove of \"gay inclination,\" \"gay relationships,\" \"enduring love between persons of the same gender,\" or \"same-sex eroticism\" (112, 166-17). ________________________________________________________ 4. d.s. bailey, homosexuality and the western christian tradition.

            "i think you may be chasing the wrong problem. i don't think it is the function overloading at all-- i do that sort of thing all of the time in bc++ without a hitch. the big problems i have encountered in porting mfc to bc++ is that fact that mfc _depends_ on a couple of invalid c++ assumptions. i have never gotten the _entire_ ctrltest app to run under bc++, but the reason is that ms makes some bad assumptions about the order in which static/global objects are initialized (i.e. some objects are getting accessed before they are initialized). the problem is in the owner-draw menu code somewhere-- if you comment out that section, all other pieces of ctrltest work fine. two other major gotchas i have found using mfc under bc++: - the cfile::openflags enum uses hard-coded numbers for the open mode, rather than the manifest constants defined in fcntrl.h (which differ between msc and bc). - all of the mfc collection classes depend on another bad c++ assumption-- that a reference to a base object can used be in place of a reference to a derived object (true for pointers, not for references). i am sure there are other problems along the same lines, but i have not encountered them (yet). i have not seen mfc 2.0 yet, but i hope that some of these will be addressed. if they are not, all of ms's hype about portability to other vendor's compilers will be just that.",

            "# i hope i gave you a fairly solid answer to this one: i simply don't agree # with the embodied version of a satan who is a separate creation or a force. # and there are quite physical descriptions of heaven and hell in the # holy qur'an, the bible, etc. there have been times in the spiritual # and intellectual evolution of the modern human when these physical # descriptions of heaven, hell, and satan were taken quite literally # and that *worked* for the time. as i mentioned in the tradition # cited above, for example, it was sufficient in the absence of a theory # about germs and disease spread by worms to simply describe the \"evil\" # which was passed to a consumer of spoiled food as \"satanic.\" which begs the question: if satan in this case is metaphorical, how can you be certain allah is not the same way? # the bottom line here, however, is that describing a spiritual plane # in human language is something like describing \"color\" to a person # who has been blind from birth. you may want to read the book # flatland (if you haven't already) or the dragon's egg. the first # is intended as a light hearted description of a mathematical con- # cept... [some deleted for space saving] # when language fails because it cannot be used to adequately describe # another dimension which cannot be experienced by the speakers, then # such conventions as metaphor, allegory, and the like come to be # necessary. the \"unseen\" is described in terms which have reference` # and meaning for the reader/listener. but, like all models, a compro- # mise must be made when speaking metaphorically: clarity and directness # of meaning, equivalence of perception, and the like are all # crippled. but what else can you do? this is why i asked the above. how would you then know god exists as a spirit or being rather than just being metaphorical? i mean, it's okay to say \"well, satan is just metaphorical,\" but then you have to justify this belief and justify that god is not some metaphor for something else. i say this because there are many, many instances of satan described as a being (such as the tormentor in the old testament book of job, or the temptor in the new testament gospels). in the same way, god too is described as a being (or spirit.) how am i to know one is metaphorical and not the other. further, belief in god isn't a bar to evil. let's consider the case of satanists: even if satan were metaphorical, the satanist would have to believe in god to justify this belief. again, we have a case where someone does believe in god, but by religious standards, they are \"evil.\" if bobby does see this, let him address this question also.

            "firstly, i would never consider trying to make a one-shot timer. your 2f2 cap will have been designed as a ram battery substitute, rather than for use in applications where you wish to drain the cap with a constant current. their performance, in some respects, is more akin to batteries than to a normal cap. the other point is that big electro's are usually rated with -5%+20% tolerances, so calculating exactly what capacitance you have (particularly when considering the cold). you should be looking at designing a micropower oscillator and divider chain, that \"rolls over\" (from zero to maximum count, or vice-versa) once every 1,209,600 seconds. if you were to use something like a 110hz clock, you would need a divider chain of 2^27, to give an error of less than one percent in the firing times over the six week period. of course, you could trim the 110hz oscillator to give you exact time, but the likelyhood of the oscillator remaining exactly constant at -40 is low anyway. i would suspect that there would be far more battrey drain in firing the solenoid than there would be in the timer circuit. caveat - i'm not experienced in low temperature electronics, so i can't guarantee that this (or any other) approach is the best for inhospitable conditions. johnh ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | _ |_ _ |_| _ _| _| electronics department |_| (_) | | | | | | (_| (_| (_| \\/ school of mpce ---------------------------------/- macquarie university sydney, australia 2109 email: johnh@mpce.mq.edu.au, ph: +61 2 805 8959, fax: +61 2 805 8983",

[isn't this refering to a biblical nimrod, rather than the babylonian god?] * ...there was a tradition in egypt, recorded by plutarch, that 'osiris was black'. ...] there is a long tradition in masonry of claiming ancient lineage for the order, on the flimsiest of grounds. this dates right back to the constitutions of 1738, which cite adam as the first mason. i've seen other claims which place masonry among the romans, greeks, and egyptians, and atlanteans. i even have a book which claims to prove that stonehenge was originally a masonic temple. claims prove nothing. where's the beef, rex?

[4/92; thanks to converse@expo.lcs.mit.edu] ---------------------------------------------------------------------- subject: 122) why doesn't xtdestroywidget() actually destroy the widget? xtdestroywidget() operates in two passes, in order to avoid leaving dangling data structures; the function-call marks the widget, which is not actually destroyed until your program returns to its event-loop. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- subject: 123) how do i query the user synchronously using xt? it is possible to have code which looks like this trivial callback, which has a clear flow of control. the calls to askuser() block until answer is set to one of the valid values. if it is not a \"yes\" answer, the code drops out of the callback and back to an event-processing loop: void quit(widget w, xtpointer client, xtpointer call) { int answer; answer = askuser(w, \"really quit?\"); if (ret_yes == answer) { answer = askuser(w, \"are you really positive?\"); if (ret_yes == answer) exit(0); } } a more realistic example might ask whether to create a file or whether to overwrite it. this is accomplished by entering a second event-processing loop and waiting until the user answers the question; the answer is returned to the calling function. that function askuser() looks something like this, where the motif can be replaced with widget-set-specific code to create some sort of dialog-box displaying the question string and buttons for \"ok\", \"cancel\" and \"help\" or equivalents: int askuser(w, string) widget w; char *string; { int answer=ret_none; /* some not-used marker */ widget dialog; /* could cache&carry, but ...*/ arg args[3]; int n = 0; xtappcontext context; n=0; xtsetarg(args[n], xmnmessagestring, xmstringcreateltor(string, xmstring_default_charset)); n++; xtsetarg(args[n], xmndialogstyle, xmdialog_application_modal); n++; dialog = xmcreatequestiondialog(xtparent(w), string, args, n); xtaddcallback(dialog, xmnokcallback, response, &answer); xtaddcallback(dialog, xmncancelcallback, response, &answer); xtaddcallback(dialog, xmnhelpcallback, response, &answer); xtmanagechild(dialog); context = xtwidgettoapplicationcontext (w); while (answer == ret_none || xtapppending(context)) { xtappprocessevent (context, xtimall); } xtdestroywidget(dialog); /* blow away the dialog box and shell */ return answer; } the dialog supports three buttons, which are set to call the same function when tickled by the user. the variable answer is set when the user finally selects one of those choices: void response(w, client, call) widget w; xtpointer client; xtpointer call; { int *answer = (int *) client; xmanycallbackstruct *reason = (xmanycallbackstruct *) call; switch (reason->reason) { case xmcr_ok: *answer = ret_yes; /* some #define value */ break; case xmcr_cancel: *answer = ret_no; break; case xmcr_help: *answer = ret_help; break; default: return; } } and the code unwraps back to the point at which an answer was needed and continues from there.

[10/92; thanks to oliver jones (oj@pictel.com)] ---------------------------------------------------------------------- subject: 127) how can my application tell if it is being run under x? a number of programs offer x modes but otherwise run in a straight character-only mode. the easiest way for an application to determine that it is running on an x display is to attempt to open a connection to the x server: display = xopendisplay(display_name); if (display) { do x stuff } else { do curses or something else } where display_name is either the string specified on the command-line following -display, by convention, or otherwise is (char*)null [in which case xopendisplay uses the value of $display, if set]. this is superior to simply checking for the existence a -display command-line argument or checking for $display set in the environment, neither of which is adequate. [5/91] ---------------------------------------------------------------------- subject: 128) how do i make a \"busy cursor\" while my application is computing? is it necessary to call xdefinecursor() for every window in my application? the easiest thing to do is to create a single inputonly window that is as large as the largest possible screen; make it a child of your toplevel window and it will be clipped to that window, so it won't affect any other application. (it needs to be as big as the largest possible screen in case the user enlarges the window while it is busy or moves elsewhere within a virtual desktop.) substitute \"toplevel\" with your top-most widget here (similar code should work for xlib-only applications; just use your top window): unsigned long valuemask; xsetwindowattributes attributes; /* ignore device events while the busy cursor is displayed. */ valuemask = cwdontpropagate | cwcursor; attributes.do_not_propagate_mask = (keypressmask | keyreleasemask | buttonpressmask | buttonreleasemask | pointermotionmask); attributes.cursor = xcreatefontcursor(xtdisplay(toplevel), xc_watch); /* the window will be as big as the display screen, and clipped by its own parent window, so we never have to worry about resizing */ xcreatewindow(xtdisplay(toplevel), xtwindow(toplevel), 0, 0, 65535, 65535, (unsigned int) 0, 0, inputonly, copyfromparent, valuemask, &attributes); where the maximum size above could be replaced by the real size of the screen, particularly to avoid servers which have problems with windows larger than 32767. when you want to use this busy cursor, map and raise this window; to go back to normal, unmap it. this will automatically keep you from getting extra mouse events; depending on precisely how the window manager works, it may or may not have a similar effect on keystrokes as well. in addition, note also that most of the xaw widgets support an xtncursor resource which can be temporarily reset, should you merely wish to change the cursor without blocking pointer events.

[thanks to pete ware (ware@cis.ohio-state.edu) and donna converse (converse@expo.lcs.mit.edu), 5/92] ---------------------------------------------------------------------- subject: 131) what are these \"xlib sequence lost\" errors? you may see these errors if you issue xlib requests from an xlib error handler, or, more likely, if you make calls which generate x requests to xt or xlib from a signal handler, which you shouldn't be doing in any case. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- subject: 132) how can my xt program handle socket, pipe, or file input? it's very common to need to write an xt program that can accept input both from a user via the x connection and from some other file descriptor, but which operates efficiently and without blocking on either the x connection or the other file descriptor. a solution is use xtappaddinput(). after you open your file descriptor, use xtappaddinput() to register an input handler. the input handler will be called every time there is something on the file descriptor requiring your program's attention. write the input handler like you would any other xt callback, so it does its work quickly and returns. it is important to use only non-blocking i/o system calls in your input handlers. most input handlers read the file descriptor, although you can have an input handler write or handle exception conditions if you wish. be careful when you register an input handler to read from a disk file. you will find that the function is called even when there isn't input pending. xtappaddinput() is actually working as it is supposed to. the input handler is called whenever the file descriptor is ready to be read, not only when there is new data to be read. a disk file (unlike a pipe or socket) is almost always ready to be read, however, if only because you can spin back to the beginning and read data you've read before. the result is that your function will almost always be called every time around xtappmainloop(). there is a way to get the type of interaction you are expecting; add this line to the beginning of your function to test whether there is new data: if (ioctl(fd, fionread, &n) == -1 || n == 0) return; but, because this is called frequently, your application is effectively in a busy-wait; you may be better off not using xtappaddinput() and instead setting a timer and in the timer procedure checking the file for input.

[courtesy mark a. horstman (mh2620@sarek.sbc.com), 11/90] ---------------------------------------------------------------------- subject: 134) why doesn't anything appear when i run this simple program? you are right to map the window before drawing into it. however, the window is not ready to be drawn into until it actually appears on the screen -- until your application receives an expose event. drawing done before that will generally not appear. you'll see code like this in many programs; this code would appear after window was created and mapped: while (!done) { xnextevent(the_display,&the_event); switch (the_event.type) { case expose: /* on expose events, redraw */ xdrawline(the_display,the_window,the_gc,5,5,100,100); break; ... } } note that there is a second problem: some xlib implementations don't set up the default graphics context to have correct foreground/background colors, so this program could previously include this code: ... the_gc_values.foreground=blackpixel(the_display,the_screen); /* e.g. */ the_gc_values.background=whitepixel(the_display,the_screen); /* e.g. */ the_gc = xcreategc(the_display,the_window, gcforeground|gcbackground,&the_gc_values); ... note: the code uses blackpixel and whitepixel to avoid assuming that 1 is black and 0 is white or vice-versa. the relationship between pixels 0 and 1 and the colors black and white is implementation-dependent. they may be reversed, or they may not even correspond to black and white at all. also note that actually using blackpixel and whitepixel is usually the wrong thing to do in a finished program, as it ignores the user's preference for foreground and background. and also note that you can run into the same situation in an xt-based program if you draw into the xtwindow(w) right after it has been realized; it may not yet have appeared. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- subject: 135) what is the difference between a screen and a screen? the 'screen' is an xlib structure which includes the information about one of the monitors or virtual monitors which a single x display supports. a server can support several independent screens. they are numbered unix:0.0, unix:0.1, unix:0.2, etc; the 'screen' or 'screen_number' is the second digit -- the 0, 1, 2 which can be thought of as an index into the array of available screens on this particular display connection. the macros which you can use to obtain information about the particular screen on which your application is running typically have two forms -- one which takes a screen and one with takes both the display and the screen_number. in xt-based programs, you typically use xtscreen(widget) to determine the screen on which your application is running, if it uses a single screen. (part of the confusion may arise from the fact that some of the macros which return characteristics of the screen have \"display\" in the names -- xdisplaywidth, xdisplayheight, etc.) ---------------------------------------------------------------------- subject: 136) can i use c++ with x11? motif? xview? the x11r4/5 header files are compatible with c++. the motif 1.1 header files are usable as is inside extern \"c\" {...}. however, the definition of string in intrinsic.h can conflict with the libg++ or other string class and needs to be worked around. some other projects which can help: wwl, a set of c++ classes by jean-daniel fekete to wrap x toolkit widgets, available via anonymous ftp from export.lcs.mit.edu as contrib/wwl-1.2.tar.z [7/92] or lri.lri.fr (129.175.15.1) as pub/wwl-1.2.tar.z. it works by building a set of c++ classes in parallel to the class tree of the widgets. the c++ interviews toolkit is obtainable via anonymous ftp from interviews.stanford.edu. interviews uses a box/glue model similar to that of tex for constructing user interfaces and supports multiple looks on the user interfaces. some of its sample applications include a wysiwig document editor (doc), a macdraw-like drawing program (idraw) and an interface builder (ibuild). things, a class library written at the rome air force base by the strategic air command, available as freeware on archive sites. motif++ is a public-domain library that defines c++ class wrappers for motif 1.1; it adds an \"application\" class for, e.g., initializing x, and also integrates wcl and the xbae widget set. this work was developed by ronald van loon <rvloon@cv.ruu.nl> based on x++, a set of bindings done by the university of lowell graphics research laboratory. the current sources are available from decuac.dec.com (192.5.214.1) as /pub/x11/motif++.21.jul.92.tar.z. the source code examples for doug young's \"object-oriented programming with c++ and osf/motif\" [isbn 0-13-630252-1] do not include \"widget wrappers\" but do include a set of classes that encapsulates higher-level facilities commonly needed by motif- or other xt-based applications; check export in ~ftp/contrib/young.c++.tar.z. rogue wave offers \"view.h++\" for c++ programmers using motif; info: 1-800-487-3217 or +1 503 754 2311. a product called \"commonview\" by glockenspiel ltd, ireland (??) apparently is a c++-based toolkit for multiple window systems, including pm, windows, and x/motif. xv++ is sold by qualix (415-572-0200; fax -1300); it implements an interface from the gil files that sun's openwindows developers guide 3.0 produces to xview wrapper classes in c++. uit is a set of c++ classes embedding the xview toolkit; it is intended for use with sun's openwindows developers guide 3.0 builder tool. sources are on export.mit.edu.au as uit.tar.z. version 2 was released 5/28/92. also of likely use is objectcenter (saber-c++). and a reasonable alternative to all of the above is parcplace's (formerly solbourne's) object interface.

[courtesy dave lemke of ncd and stuart marks of sun] note that the same applies to the border pixel/pixmap. this is a (mis)feature of the protocol which allows the server is free to manipulate the pixel/pixmap however it wants. by not requiring the server to keep the original pixel or pixmap, some (potentially a lot of) space can be saved. [courtesy jim fulton, mit x consortium] ---------------------------------------------------------------------- subject: 139) how do i create a transparent window? a completely transparent window is easy to get -- use an inputonly window. in order to create a window which is *mostly* transparent, you have several choices: - the shape extension first released with x11r4 offers an easy way to make non-rectangular windows, so you can set the shape of the window to fit the areas where the window should be nontransparent; however, not all servers support the extension. - a machine-specific method of implementing transparent windows for particular servers is to use an overlay plane supported by the hardware. note that there is no x notion of a \"transparent color index\". - a generally portable solution is to use a large number of tiny windows, but this makes operating on the application as a unit difficult. - a final answer is to consider whether you really need a transparent window or if you would be satisfied with being able to overlay your application window with information; if so, you can draw into separate bitplanes in colors that will appear properly. [thanks to der mouse, mouse@lightning.mcrcim.mcgill.edu, 3/92; see also the x journal 1:4 for a more complete answer, including code samples for this last option] ---------------------------------------------------------------------- subject: 140) why doesn't gxxor produce mathematically-correct color values? when using gxxor you may expect that drawing with a value of black on a background of black, for example, should produce white. however, the drawing operation does not work on rgb values but on colormap indices. the color that the resulting colormap index actually points to is undefined and visually random unless you have actually filled it in yourself. [on many x servers black and white often 0/1 or 1/0; programs taking advantage of this mathematical coincidence will break.] if you want to be combining colors with gxxor, then you should be allocating a number of your own color cells and filling them with your chosen pre-computed values. if you want to use gxxor simply to switch between two colors, then you can take the shortcut of setting the background color in the gc (graphics context) to 0 and the foreground color to a value such that when it draws over red, say, the result is blue, and when it draws over blue the result is red. this foreground value is itself the xor of the colormap indices of red and blue.

[thanks to paul asente, asente@adobe.com, 7/91] ---------------------------------------------------------------------- subject: 142) why can't my program get a standard colormap? i have an image-processing program which uses xgetrgbcolormap() to get the standard colormap, but it doesn't work. xgetrgbcolormap() when used with the property xa_rgb_default_map does not create a standard colormap -- it just returns one if one already exists. use xstdcmap or do what it does in order to create the standard colormap first. [1/91; from der mouse (mouse@larry.mcrcim.mcgill.edu)] ---------------------------------------------------------------------- subject: 143) why does the pixmap i copy to the screen show up as garbage? the initial contents of pixmaps are undefined. this means that most servers will allocate the memory and leave around whatever happens to be there -- which is usually garbage. you probably want to clear the pixmap first using xfillrectangle() with a function of gxcopy and a foreground pixel of whatever color you want as your background (or 0l if you are using the pixmap as a mask). [courtesy dave lemke of ncd and stuart marks of sun] ---------------------------------------------------------------------- subject: 144) how do i check whether a window id is valid? my program has the id of a window on a remote display. i want to check whether the window exists before doing anything with it. because x is asynchronous, there isn't a guarantee that the window would still exist between the time that you got the id and the time you sent an event to the window or otherwise manipulated it. what you should do is send the event without checking, but install an error handler to catch any badwindow errors, which would indicate that the window no longer exists. this scheme will work except on the [rare] occasion that the original window has been destroyed and its id reallocated to another window. [courtesy ken lee (klee@synoptics.com), 4/90] ---------------------------------------------------------------------- subject: 145) can i have two applications draw to the same window? yes. the x server assigns ids to windows and other resources (actually, the server assigns some bits, the client others), and any application that knows the id can manipulate the resource [almost any x server resource, except for gcs and private color cells, can be shared]. the problem you face is how to disseminate the window id to multiple applications. a simple way to handle this (and which solves the problem of the applications' running on different machines) is in the first application to create a specially-named property on the root-window and put the window id into it. the second application then retrieves the property, whose name it also knows, and then can draw whatever it wants into the window. [note: this scheme works iff there is only one instance of the first application running, and the scheme is subject to the limitations mentioned in the question about using window ids on remote displays.] note also that you will still need to coordinate any higher-level cooperation among your applications. note also that two processes can share a window but should not try to use the same server connection. if one process is a child of the other, it should close down the connection to the server and open its own connection. [mostly courtesy phil karlton (karlton@wpd.sgi.com) 6/90] ---------------------------------------------------------------------- subject: 146) why can't my program work with tvtwm or swm? a number of applications, including xwd, xwininfo, and xsetroot, do not handle the virtual root window which tvtwm and swm use; they typically return the wrong child of root. a general solution is to add this code or to use it in your own application where you would normally use rootwindow(dpy,screen): /* function name: getvroot * description: gets the root window, even if it's a virtual root * arguments: the display and the screen * returns: the root window for the client */ #include <x11/xatom.h> window getvroot(dpy, scr) display *dpy; int scr; { window rootreturn, parentreturn, *children; unsigned int numchildren; window root = rootwindow(dpy, scr); atom __swm_vroot = none; int i; __swm_vroot = xinternatom(dpy, \"__swm_vroot\", false); xquerytree(dpy, root, &rootreturn, &parentreturn, &children, &numchildren); for (i = 0; i < numchildren; i++) { atom actual_type; int actual_format; long nitems, bytesafter; window *newroot = null; if (xgetwindowproperty(dpy, children[i], __swm_vroot, 0, 1, false, xa_window, &actual_type, &actual_format, &nitems, &bytesafter, (unsigned char **) &newroot) == success && newroot) { root = *newroot; break; } } return root; } [courtesy david elliott (dce@smsc.sony.com). similar code is in ssetroot, a version of xsetroot distributed with tvtwm. 2/91] a header file by andreas stolcke of icsi on export.lcs.mit.edu:contrib/vroot.h functions similarly by providing macros for rootwindow and defaultrootwindow; code can include this header file first to run properly in the presence of a virtual desktop. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- subject: 147) how do i keep a window from being resized by the user? resizing the window is done through the window manager; window managers can pay attention to the size hints your application places on the window, but there is no guarantee that the window manager will listen. you can try setting the minimum and maximum size hints to your target size and hope for the best. [1/91] ---------------------------------------------------------------------- subject: 148) how do i keep a window in the foreground at all times? it's rather antisocial for an application to constantly raise itself [e.g. by tracking visibilitynotify events] so that it isn't overlapped -- imagine the conflict between two such programs running. the only sure way to have your window appear on the top of the stack is to make the window override-redirect; this means that you are temporarily assuming window-management duties while the window is up, so you want to do this infrequently and then only for short periods of time (e.g. for popup menus or other short parameter-setting windows). [thanks to der mouse (mouse@larry.mcrcim.mcgill.edu); 7/92] ---------------------------------------------------------------------- subject: 149) how do i make text and bitmaps blink in x? there is no easy way. unless you're willing to depend on some sort of extension (as yet non-existent), you have to arrange for the blinking yourself, either by redrawing the contents periodically or, if possible, by playing games with the colormap and changing the color of the contents. [thanks to mouse@larry.mcrcim.mcgill.edu (der mouse), 7/91] ---------------------------------------------------------------------- subject: 150)+ how do i get a double-click in xlib? users of xt have the support of the translation manager to help get notification of double-clicking. there is no good way to get only a double-click in xlib, because the protocol does not provide enough support to do double-clicks. you have to do client-side timeouts, unless the single-click action is such that you can defer actually taking it until you next see an event from the server. thus, you have to do timeouts, which means system-dependent code. on most unixish implementations, you can use xconnectionnumber to get the file descriptor of the x connection and then use select() or something similar on that. note that many user-interface references suggest that a double-click be used to extend the action indicated by a single-click; if this is the case in your interface then you can execute the first action and as a compromise check the timestamp on the second event to determine whether it, too, should be the single-click action or the double-click action. [thanks to mouse@larry.mcrcim.mcgill.edu (der mouse), 4/93] ---------------------------------------------------------------------- subject: 151)! how do i render rotated text? xlib intentionally does not provide such sophisticated graphics capabilities, leaving them up to server-extensions or clients-side graphics libraries. your only choice, if you want to stay within the core x protocol, is to render the text into a pixmap, read it back via xgetimage(), rotate it \"by hand\" with whatever matrices you want, and put it back to the server via xputimage(); more specifically: 1) create a bitmap b and write your text to it. 2) create an xybitmap image i from b (via xgetimage). 3) create an xybitmap image i2 big enough to handle the transformation. 4) for each x,y in i2, i2(x,y) = i(a,b) where a = x * cos(theta) - y * sin(theta) b = x * sin(theta) + y * cos(theta) 5) render i2 note that you should be careful how you implement this not to lose bits; an algorithm based on shear transformations may in fact be better. the high-level server-extensions and graphics packages available for x also permit rendering of rotated text: display postscript, pex, phigs, and gks, although most are not capable of arbitrary rotation and probably do not use the same fonts that would be found on a printer. in addition, if you have enough access to the server to install a font on it, you can create a font which consists of letters rotated at some predefined angle. your application can then itself figure out placement of each glyph.

[brian r. smith (brsmith@cs.umn.edu), 3/91] another possibility is to use the hershey fonts; they are stroke-rendered and can be used by x by converting them into xdrawline requests. [eric@pencom.com, 10/91] the xrotfont program by alan richardson (mppa3@syma.sussex.ac.uk) (posted to comp.sources.x july 14 1992) paints a rotated font by implementing the method above and by using an outline (hershey) font. the xvertext package by alan richardson (mppa3@syma.sussex.ac.uk) is a set of functions to facilitate the writing of text at any angle. version 3.0 was recently released to alt.sources and comp.sources.misc [3/93]; it is also on export as contrib/xvertext.3.0.shar.z. o'reilly's x resource volume 3 includes information from hp about modifications to the x fonts server which provide for rotated and scaled text. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- subject: 152) what is the x registry? (how do i reserve names?) there are places in the x toolkit, in applications, and in the x protocol that define and use string names. the context is such that conflicts are possible if different components use the same name for different things. the mit x consortium maintains a registry of names in these domains: orgainization names, selection names, selection targets, resource types, application classes, and class extension record types; and several others. the list as of 7/91 is in the directory mit/doc/registry on the r5 tape; it is also available by sending \"send docs registry\" to the xstuff mail server. to register names (first come, first served) or to ask questions send to xregistry@expo.lcs.mit.edu; be sure to include a postal address for confirmation.

            "according to what i have read on biblical idioms, speaking \"in x's name\" is a standard aramaic/hebrew legal idiom for what we today would call power of attorney. a person from jesus' culture authorized to conduct business \"in john's name\" had full authority over john's financial affairs, but was held under a solemn fiduciary obligation to work only for john's benefit and consonant with john's wishes. it was not required for the steward to preface each business transaction with \"in john's name\"; it was sufficient to have valid power of attorney and be operating in good faith. (note the overlap here between legal and religious definitions of \"faith\".) with this cultural background, praying \"in jesus' name\" does not mandate a particular verbal formula; rather it requires that the petitioner be operating faithfully and consciously within an analogous \"fiduciary\" relationship with jesus and for the purposes of his kingdom. the message of \"praying in jesus' name\" is thus closely aligned with the parable of the talents and other passages about god's delegation of kingdom business to his stewards, both resources and responsibilities. this idea of praying \"in jesus' name\" is not only present but prominent in the lord's prayer, although the verbal forumula is absent. the act of praying the words \"in jesus' name\" may be beneficial if they cause us to clarify the relationship of our requests to the advancement of god's kingdom. for that reason, i'm not quite ready to say that the praying the formula is without meaning. prayers to god for other purposes (desperation, anger, thanksgiving, etc.) don't seem to be in this category at all, whether uttered by christian or non-christian, whether b.c. or a.d.

            "well, here is something i wrote some time ago in response to a similar question. i hope it helps: [begin repeat of previous post] as for the scripture mentioned i agree that it does seem to be a problem, not only for eternal marriage but marriage in general. luke's version has jesus saying that the children of this world marry and are given in marriage but not those who will attain the kingdom of heaven. it almost sounds like marriage disqualifies one for salvation. (matthew and mark both omit this statement.) i think the accounts are not as clear as they might be. let's have a look at the incident and see if we can come up with some reasonable ideas of what it means. the scriptures involved are mat 22:23-30, mark 12:18-25, and luke 20:27-36. what happened was that the sadducees, who did not believe in the resurrection, thought they could trap jesus. they made reference to the \"leverite\" marriage which required the brother of a man who died without children to take the widow to wife and raise up children. the children would be considered children of the deceased, just as though the woman's first husband had fathered them. it seems obvious from this that the woman was still considered in a way to be the wife of her first husband. however, the sadducees concocted a scene in which 6 brothers of the deceased each in his turn failed to father children by the widow. they seem to imply that the leverite marriage was equal to the first for they ask, \"whose wife shall she be in the resurrection?\" at this point it seems obvious that if she is anybody's wife, it is the first husband. after all, had she borne children they would have been credited to him regardless of which brother was the biological father. it is possible jesus was refering to this when he says, \"ye do err, not knowing the scriptures or the power of god.\" (mat 22:29, compare mark 12:24, phrase not in luke's account). anyway, the sadducees ask, \"whose wife will she be in the resurrection, seeing that all 7 had her?\" jesus answer is that, \"in the resurrection they neither marry nor are given in marriage...\" (mat 22:30) \"when they rise from the dead they neither marry...\" (mark 12:25) \"they which are accounted worthy to obtain that world neither marry...\" (luke 20:35) all 3 accounts go on to say, \"but are as the angels in heaven\" or the equivalent. i find this last not very helpful since the bible does not define angels nor give any idea what their life is like.

(pretty cool, eh?) he became closely involved with the early church, the leaders of which were followers of jesus throughout his ministry on earth. i agree. i don't believe anyone but the spirit would be able to convince you the spirit exists. please don't complain about this being circular. i know it is, but really, can anything of the natural world explain the supernatural? (this is why revelation is necessary to the authors of the bible.) the spirit is part of god. how much closer to the source can you get? the greek in 2 timothy which is sometimes translated as \"inspired by god\", literally means \"god-breathed\". in other words, god spoke the actual words into the scriptures. many theologians and bible scholars (dr. james boice is one that i can remember off-hand) get quite annoyed by the dryness and incompleteness of \"inspired by god\". that's what the verse taken from 2 timothy was all about. the continuity of a book written over a span of 1500 years by more than 40 authors from all walks of life is a testimony to the single authorship of god. what source to you claim to have discovered which has information of superior historicity to the bible? certainly not josephus' writings, or the writings of the gnostics which were third century, at the earliest. jesus was fully god as well. that's why i'd assert that he is wise. please rethink this last paragraph. if there is no god, which seems to be your current belief, then jesus was either a liar or a complete nut because not only did he assert that god exists, but he claimed to be god himself! (regards to c.s. lewis) how then could you have the least bit of respect for jesus? in conclusion, be careful about logically unfounded hypotheses based on gut feelings about the text and other scholars' unsubstantiated claims. the bible pleads that we take it in its entirety or throw the whole book out. about your reading of the bible, not only does the spirit inspire the writers, but he guides the reader as well. we cannot understand it in the least without the spirit's guidance: \"for to us god revealed them through the spirit; for the spirit searches all things, even the depths of god.\" (1 cor 2:10, nas) peace and may god guide us in wisdom. +-=-+-=-+-=-+-=-+-=-+-=-+-=-+-=-+-=-+-=-+-=-+-=-+-=-+-=-+-=-+-=-+-=-+-=-+-=-+-= carter c. page | of happiness the crown and chiefest part is wisdom, a carpenter's apprentice | and to hold god in awe. this is the law that, cpage@seas.upenn.edu | seeing the stricken heart of pride brought down, | we learn when we are old. -adapted from sophocles +-=-+-=-+-=-+-=-+-=-+-=-+-=-+-=-+-=-+-=-+-=-+-=-+-=+-=-+-=+-=-+=-+-=-+-=-+=-+-=",

[some kinds might work better that others.] (2) divide the sample into two groups of equal weight and number. (3) sprout one group in distilled water on filter paper for three or four weeks. (4) separately incinerate both groups. (5) weigh the residue from each group. [the residue of the sprouted group will usually weigh at least several percent more than the other group.] (6) analyze quantitatively the residue of each group for mineral content. [some of the mineral atoms of the sprouted group have been transmuted into heavier mineral elements by fusing with atoms of oxygen, hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, etc..] biological transmutations occur routinely, even in our own bodies. ingesting a source of organic silicon (silicon with carbon, such as \"horsetail\" extract, or radishes) can speed healing of broken bones via the reaction si + c --> ca, (much faster than by merely ingesting the calcium directly). some mineral deposits in the ground are formed by micro- organisms fusing together atoms of silicon, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, hydrogen, etc.. the two reactions si + c <--> ca, by micro-organisms, cause \"stone sickness\" in statues, building bricks, etc.. the reaction n2 --> co, catalysed by very hot iron, creates a carbon-monoxide poison hazard for welder operators and people near woodstoves (even properly sealed ones). some bacteria can even neutralize radioactivity! all of these things and more happen, in spite of the currently accepted \"laws\" of physics, (including the law which says that atomic fusion requires extremely high temperatures and pressures.) \"biological transmutations, and their applications in chemistry, physics, biology, ecology, medicine, nutrition, agrigulture, geology\", 1st edition, by c. louis kervran, active member of new york academy of science, 1972, 163 pages, illustrated, swan house publishing co., p.o. box 638, binghamton, ny 13902 \"the secret life of plants\", by peter tompkins and christopher bird, 1973, 402 pages, harper & row, new york [chapters 19 and 20 are about \"radionics\". entire book is fascinating! ] for more information, answers to your questions, etc., please consult my cited sources (the two books). un-altered reproduction and dissemination of this important information is encouraged.",

            "my wifes uncle was a 30+ level mason. he let me look at some of the books (which after his death his \"brothers\" came over and took from his greiving widow before his body had even cooled). don't tell me you don't worship osiris. you must not be past your 20th level. you should read wilkinson's egyptians and how he shows this egyptian religion paralleling his own british masonry. there is a man here at this laboratory who is a 33 degree black mason. i've talked with him, though much he likes to hide (\"mystery\"). special handshakes and all. when he first started trying to \"evangelize\" me, he told me all kinds on special this, and special that. here is truely a \"mystery\" religion. there is the public side with motorcyle mania and childrens hospitals and then there is the priviate side that only the highest degree mason every learns of. i haven't read it, but the literature that is offered by the silver haired apologist (can't remember his name) on tv, didn't exactly come to this same conclusion. \"khons, the son of the great goddess-mother, seems to have been gernaerally represented as a full-grown god. the babylonian divinity was also represented very frequently in egupt in the very same wayas in the land of his nativity -i.e. as a child in his mother's arems. this was the way in which osiris, 'the son, the husband of his mother,' was often exhibited, and what we learn of this god, equally as in the case of khonso, shows that in his original he was none other than nimrod. it is admitted that the secret system of free masonry was originally founded on the mysteries of the egyptian isis, the goddess-mother, or wife of osiris. but what could have led to the union of a masonic body with these mysteries, had they not had particular reference to architecture, and had the god who was worshipped in them not been celebrated for his success in perfecting the arts of fortification and building? now, if such were the case, considering the relation in which, as we have already seen, egypt stood to babylon, who would naturally be liiked up to there as the great patron of the masonic art? the strong presumption is, that nimrod must have been the man. he was the first that gained faim in this way. as the child of the babylonian goddess-mother, he was worshipped in the character of ala mahozim, 'the god of fortification.' osiris, the child of the egyptian modonna, was equally celebrated as 'the strong chief of the buildings.' this strong chief of the buildings was origninally worshipped in egypt with every physicall characteristic of nimrod. i have already noticed the fact that nimrod, as the son of cush, was a negro. now, there was a tradition in egypt, recorded by plutarch, that 'osiris was black'.......\" hislop it was like a cold slap to my face, when my wifes uncle brought out his cerimonial dress and it was leopard skin. i mean real leopard skin. he told me that only the highest of degrees wore the leopard skin. (the reason that he started telling me all this was that he had just been given a couple of months to live and my wife had led him to a saving faith in christ and he immediately repented from 'mysteries' of the lodge!) nimr-rod from nimr, a \"leopard,\" and rada or rad \"to subdue.\" it is a universal principle in all idolatries, that the high priest wears the insignia of the god he serves. any representation of osiris usually show the wearing of some leopard. it is interesting that the druids of britian also show, or should i say hide, this representation. they, however, worshipped the \"spotted cow\". i'll stand by my statements. masonry is of the \"mystery\" religions that all find their source in babylon, the great harlot. sorry peter, i do not mean to be a \"cold slap to the face\" but there is to much evidence to the contrary that masonry doesn't find its origins in egypt. of the masons i have personally talked to, all refered to egypt as their origin. why are you now separating yourself from this which not many years ago, was freely admitted?",

            "[ these two paragraphs are from two different posts. in splicing them together it is not my intention to change steve's meaning or misrepresent him in any way. i don't *think* i've done so. ] part of what started this was my earlier example of illinois, usa requiring anyone doing more than x automobile transfers a year (x = 10, i think) to become licensed as a used car dealer. in addition, it requirs anyone with a used car dealer's license to own at least 10 cars at a time, all the time. let me continue with this example and try to answer steve's questions. steve, let's say you have the talent and inclination to fix up and resell cars. either you've gotten good enough at it in your spare time to bump up against these limits, or you would like to do it full-time but these stupid, arbitrary laws prevent you from starting out small and pulling yourself up. so i'm protected from a hungry neighborhood competitor willing to take a low profit while working extra hard to fulfill my needs, and you're protected from doing what you want with your life. here's what i see libertarianism offering you: your money is truly yours; it belongs to you. you can use it to buy a car. if you use it to buy a car, it is truly your car; it belongs to you. you can use your money to fix up that car. since it is your car, you can sell that car. your life is truly yours; it belongs to you. it matters not if someone thinks that it's \"wrong\" for you to buy and sell 10 cars within 12 months rather than, say, 9 cars. they may dissaprove, but it is not their life or their money, it is your life and your money. my money is truly mine; it belongs to me. i can use it to buy a car. perhaps your car. perhaps that 10th car, the one that someone, somewhere dissaproves of you selling and, presumably, of me buying. that someone could go to the government and insist that the government make us stop it. but the government would be powerless to stop us from doing what we like with our own property, in the abscence of fraud or agression. and it would be powerless to stop us from associating with each other. this does not seem to me to be a utopian dream, but basic human decency and common sense. a real grass-roots example of freedom and liberty. and yes, not having a few people acting as our masters, approving or rejecting each of our basic transactions with each other, does strike me as a wonderful way to improve the human condition.",

            "at the risk of getting lost in the clipper chip discussion i give a summary on my recent question: unfortunately the answer is no - concealing the initialisation vector essentially doesn't give any additional security. i got 3 answers (from grady@netcom.com, mark.lomas@cl.cam.ac.uk, smb@research.att.com) that opened my eyes. it's pretty simple: say e is encryption (and d decryption) with key k on 64-bit blocks. let c[0] be the initialisation vector, m[1], m[2], ... the message blocks, c[1], c[2], ... the cipher text blocks. then encryption in cipher block chaining (cbc) mode works by the formula c[i] = e(m[i] xor c[i-1]), and decryption by m[i] = c[i-1] xor d(c[i]). so if the attacker doesn't have c[0] this only affects the first message block m[1]. but she can do her key search attack on m[2], m[3], ... the situation in cipher feedback (cfb) mode is a bit more complicated but similar and left as an exercise for the reader :-) finally there is the modified output feedback mode (ofb) where des (or whatever block cipher you use) simply acts as random generator by s[i] = e(s[i-1]) with initialisation vector (= seed) s[0], and encryption is given by c[i] = m[i] xor s[i]. here the usual `known plaintext' attack against xor-bitstream ciphers reduces the cracking to key search for k.",

[or maybe the crusades? -m] you cannot even imagine the horror that will take place under the antichrist's rule; it will be much worse than anything in history (matt 24:21) \"...i saw under the altar the souls of those who had been slain for the word of god and for the testimony which they held. and a white robe was given to each of them: and it was said to them that they should rest a little while longer, until both the number of the fellow servants and their brethren, who would be killed as they were, was completed.\" revelation 6:9, 11. his targets will be jews and christians who do not worship his image or take the mark on their forehead or right hadn/ \"...and i saw the souls of those who had been beheaded for their witness to jesus and for the word of god, who had not worshiped the beast or his image, and had not received his mark on their foreheads or on the hands.\" - revelation 20:4. he will use every form of torture and humiliation in order to force you to renounce christ. nor will he hesitate to use your loved ones against you, even your children, torturing and killing them in front of you so that you will be tempted to take the mark. if you take the mark or worship the antichrist or his image, however, you will be consigned to the second death, which is the lake of fire. [sung about so eloquently by johnny cash...-m] you cannot be redeemed. it is better to endure torture for a short while and gain eternal life then [sic] to endure eternal torment in the ring^h^h^h^h lake of fire. \"...if anyone worships the beast and his image, and receives his mark on his forehead or on his hand, he himself shall also drink the wine of the wrath of god, which is poured out full strength into the cup of his indignation. an [sic] he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels and in the presence of the lamb.\" -revelation 14:9-10 [and probably in the presence of season-ticket holders; special hats given to the first 5,000 at the stadium --m] vii. set a plan in motion for survival although you may not be able to hide from the antichrist's government until the end of the tribulation, all of the time you gain in hiding is important for your spiritual growth and strengthening, since only those who are extremely strong in christ can suffer and die for his sake. the first thing to do is move out of the city and into a rural or mountainous area, for the antichrist's control will come last to the least populated areas. take a good radio or tv with you so that you can stay attuned to events and discern the time schedule of the tribulation. [\"as you can see on the weather map, heavy currents of tribulation will sweep into our area by daybreak. expect delays on i-95 outbound, and perhaps school closings\" --m] store water and food, because you will not be able to purchase anything without the mark. water in lakes and streams will be polluted by radioactive waste from nuclear warfare and will eventually turn into blood.

[perot supporters take note --m] ix. watch for the antichrist it is important to realize who the antichrist is and what he is up to, for he will deceive many into thinking that he is a great world leader who will bring peace and prosperity to a world hungry for it. we can infer from daniel 11 certain characteristics of this man. popular during the first three and a half years of the tribulation, he will dominate the airwaves. he will be physically appealing, highly intelligent, with christ-like charisma and personality. an international politician, military tactician and economic expert, his word will be peace; he will make a treaty with the jews, which he will break after three and a half years. he will have such supernatural power that a mortal wound to his head will be healed. even the very elect will be deceived. if you do not pray and read the bible, you too will be deceived. [dominate the airwaves? perhaps howard stern or rush limbaugh...-m] the antichrist will have a companion, the false prohphet [sic], who will make an image in the likeness of the antichrist and cause it to speak. all who refuse to worhsip [sic] the image will be killed. the final three and a half years will be absolutely insane, with demonized spirits everywhere. x. do not give up hope! the seven years of tribulation will end with the triumphant return of christ. the antichrist will be defeated. be steadfast and endure, and you will be rewarded greatly in heaven. start reading the bible and praying fervently now. the salvation of your sould depends upon it. determine that, come what may, you will not take the mark or worship the antichrist. you still have a chance to be saved or remain saved, but this time you will have to be \"faithful unto death.\" may god find you ready in the hour of his glorious return! ****************************************************************************** mike cluff * \"christianity is stupid. v22964qs@ubvms or mike%luick@ubvms * give up.\" -negativland ub language perception laboratory * ****************************************************************************** /\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\ bob beauchaine bobbe@vice.ico.tek.com they said that queens could stay, they blew the bronx away, and sank manhattan out at sea.",

            "from: new liberation news service <nlns> subject: nlns: fascism with a friendly face /* written 8:33 pm apr 14, 1993 by nlns@igc.apc.org in igc:nlns.news */ /* ---------- \"nlns packet 3.11 *** 4-14-93\" ---------- */ fascism with a friendly face: does rush limbaugh remind you of anyone? daevid bornhuetter-machen, the madison edge \"the main difference between adolf hitler and rush limbaugh is that hitler was original and showed initiative.\" --mort sahl on the tom snyder radio show, abc radio network, october 27, 1992. (nlns)--believe it or not, i was planning this comparative review of mein kampf and limbaugh's transcribed rant, the way things ought to be before sahl issued his comparative review. as usual, sahl's was independent and sharp as a scalpel. my effort can only dream of comparing favorably to mort's. at least it has a fairly popular orginating premise; everyone i'd mention the idea to thought it was either divinely inspired or at least past due for delivery. those reactions are based on parallels that should be obvious to the most peripheral observer of the acts of those false prophets. both are noted for their galvanizing oratorical skills, which they both used with passion to generate a political cult of massive numerical proportions (in fact, limbaugh claims to have an audience of just over 12 million, almost identical to the number of votes cast for hitler in the april 1932 german election). both used a myopic social perspective to build the cult, and enthusiastically amputated facts from the record to fabricate their ideological quilt. the last point is glaringly documented by passages in the opening pages of both books. hitler's example is when, on page 5, he claims the german nationalist terrorist leo schlageter (he bombed part of a railway line between dusseldorf and duisburg, being caught in the act, in 1923) was \"betrayed to france by a representative of his government\" when there has never been any factual foundation for such a statement. in fact, the governments of both the reich and prussia, as well as the vatican, actively intervened to save him from execution, and almost succeeded. limbaugh follows suit by making the hysterically sarcastic claim in his introduction that \"in a school or during a commencement ceremony or many other public places... god is unconstitutional.\" of course, it's not god but the official imposition of particular concepts of god against an individual's will that's unconstitutional. but limbaugh is too gleeful in his talent for distortion to want you to know that. of course, one would assume that, by comparing the two books, my main point would be that the way things ought to be is the modern american mein kampf. not really. at the time of the first german version of mein kampf, hitler was just four months out of prison (june, 1925), and trying to reorganize the nazis. he used the book to build his dozen million followers. limbaugh, on the other hand, came up with his book after building his dozen million. twelve million went a longer way in weimar germany that it does in the republicrat united states. thus, the more accurate parallels would be that limbaugh's daily three-hour radio show is the american mein kampf, the primary propoganda tool used to pump up the angry volume; and that the way things ought to be is actually the american triumph of the will, a translation of the same fascist message into a different medium. also, the printed word was the more important medium in weimar germany, since radio was still being thought of by impoverished germans as a medium of luxury in 1925. today, on the other hand, americans are more likely to spend a few seconds to tune a radio dial at no monetary charge than drop $22 for 304 pages of transcripts of the same words. but, as mort sahl also observed on the radio the other night, some cloutmeister of the radical right wants limbaugh to be a focal point of their propoganda. (and remember, sahl is an al haig conservative these days.) mort might not know exactly who rush's equivalent of rodolf hess is (the book itself suggests ed mclaughlin, the former president of abc radio and now limbaugh's partner in efm media, the radio program's production company). but mort himself is a veteran of the talk show, having hosted them in new york, washington and los angeles. he knows what evil lurks in the hearts of major market media men. he knows that limbaugh could not have collected his audience had not the opportunity been placed on a silver platter and handed to him. limbaugh earns his money just as honestly as al capone did; it's almost worthy of a rico indictment. on questions of social issues, there is an overabundance of material in the limbaugh book that seems to echo hitler's venom. for example: on their own qualifications to control society hitler: \"out of the host of sometimes millions of people, who individually more or less clearly and distinctly guess the truth, partly perhaps understand it, one man [author's emphasis] must step forward in order to form, with apodeictic force, out of the wavering world of imagination of the great masses, granite principles, and to take up the fight for their sole correctness, until out of the playing waves of a free world of thought a brazen rock of uniform combination of form and will arises\" (page 577). limbaugh: \"who needs the media when they've got me? ... the show is devoted exclusively to what i think ... [the phrase \"with half my brain tied behind my back to make it even\"] denotes the egress of mental aptitude i require to engage and demolish liberals and others who disagree with me ... it might take four or five years, but i'm convinced the media will slowly and reluctantly come around to my way of thinking, kicking and screaming all the way.\" (pages 266, 21, 299 and 273, respectively.) on religion as the basis of a nation hitler: \"in this world human culture and civilization are inseperably bound up with the existence of the aryan. his dying-off or his decline would again lower upon this earth the dark veils of a time without culture ... he who dares to lay hand upon the highest image of the lord sins against the benevolent creator of this miracle and helps in the expulsion from paradise.\" (page 581.) limbaugh: \"america was founded as a judeo-christian country ... but our intellectual and political elites are often either hostile or ambivalent toward religion ... people for whom belief in god is at best a charming superstition have managed to ban prayer from the public schools for the last thirty years. is it only a coincidence that the quality of american education has declined ever since?\" (pages 274-5.) on popular culture as a reason for social collapse hitler: \"the fight against the poisoning of the soul has to set in ... one has only to look at the menus of our movie houses, vaudevilles and theatres; and one can hardly deny that this is not the right kind of food ... theatre, art, literature, movies, the press, billposters and window displays must be cleaned of the symptoms of a rotting world and put into the service of a moral idea of state and culture.\" (pages 346 and 348.) limbaugh: \"today, hollywood is in trouble. the reason [is] that hollywood has forgotten who its audience is ... they make fun of people who believe in god. they ridicule the traditional family, heterosexuality and monagamy. they disparage american heroes.\" (page 254.) on the news meida hitler: \"the activity of the so-called liberal press was the work of gravediggers for the german people and the german reich. one can pass by in silence the marxist papers of lies ... it's task is only to break the people's folkish and national spine, in order to make it ripe for the yoke of slavery of international capital and its masters, the jews.\" (page 331.) limbaugh: \"elements of the media have jumped on the bandwagon of leftist causes. the cynical journalist of the past has been replaced in many cases by an enthusiastic cheerleader for causes ... during the gulf war, cnn correspondent bernard shaw [said] cnn is a global network. we can't take sides. cant take sides? --- --- ---! ... if they don't realize that their freedom lies in the united states of america and that therefore they should defend this nation, they are hopelessly misguided and, may i suggest, flirting with megalomania.\" (pages 270 and 268.) * * * to continue these comparative excerpts is certainly possible, but ultimately too depressing to take in one reading. after putting these books down, there is one undeniable fact that haunts me. in the 1920s, adolf hitler fed depressed and frightened germans the opiate of hatred of those around them; in turn, it allowed germans to hand their collective national power to the nazis. in the 1990s, rush limbaugh is doing the very same thing: distributing hatred to depressed and frightened americans; in turn, it is helping the american radical right to maintain its power base as the 12-year nightmare of the reagan-bush era comes to an end, hoping to rebuild it into their hopes for the fascist states of america. and if limbaugh is not as repellant a hitler, it is only because the radical right utilizes limbaugh as its own gateway opiate. one can only wonder what the ultimate drug is they plan to hook america on. the madison edge can be reached at po box 845, madison, wi 53701- 0845; (608) 255-4460.",

            "from: _quantum_ magazine, march/april 1993 pages 42-46 the problem book of anania of shirak ------------------------------------ \"on the ancient peak of ararat the centuries have come like seconds and passed on.\" -avetik issahakian by yuri danilov some years ago journalists interviewing celebrities liked to ask them: \"what books would you take with you if you were to go off on a space flight?\" and though the number of books allowed on the trip varied from 10 to 30, depending on the type of spacecraft and the generosity of the interviewer, and celebrities are people of the most varied tastes, ages, and professions, not one of them dared to say that he or she would want to take with them at least one book of arithmetic problems. some of these people certainly excluded this kind of literature because they were trained in the humanities and had nothing but scorn for \"numbers\" (though secretly afraid of them). others steered clear of such puzzle books because they were masters of incomparably more difficult branches of modern mathematics and didn't mind saying for all the world to hear that they didn't know how to solve mere arithmetic problems. professional mathematicians were no exception. here's what the russian mathematician alexander khinchin, a specialist in statistics, wrote about arithmetic: \"i willingly confess that any time a fifth-grader asked me to help solve an arithmetic problem, it was a hard work for me, and sometimes i failed completely. of course, like most of my friends, i could easily solve the problem by the natural algebraic route --constructing equations or sets of equations. but we were supposed to avoid using algebraic analysis at all costs! . . . by the way, it's a fact that is well known and oft repeated that, as a rule, neither high school graduates, nor students at teaching colleges, nor teachers beginning their careers (nor, i must add, scientific researchers) can solve arithmetic problems. it seems the only people in the world who are able to solve them are fifth-grade teachers.\" now, i'm not insisting that a book of arithmetic problems be included in the bookbag of anyone flying into space. but a sense of justice induces me to recommend one particular problem book, one that will satisfy the most fastidious taste and supply food for thought sufficient not only for a relatively short flight to the moon but for a extended space voyage--say, to venus and back. one for the \"road\" they both took out the books they brought for the road. kingsley glanced at the royal astronomer's book and saw a bright cover with a group of cutthroats shooting at each other with revolvers. \"god knows what this kind of stuff leads to,\" thought kingsley. the royal astronomer looked at kingsley's book and saw the history of herodotus. \"good lord, next he'll be reading thucydides,\" thought the royal astronomer. --fred hoyle, the black cloud the book i'm talking about isn't very big, but its 24 problems constitute 24 elegant miniatures from seventh-century armenia. naive and wise at the same time, rich in striking detail and the bright coloration of the period, these problems are reminiscent of the reliefs on the famous monument of armenian architecture, the church on the island of akhtamar in lake van (in what is now turkey_. they are as inseparable from the image of armenia as the elegant letters of the armenian alphabet, invented by mesrop mashtots, or the songs of komitas, or the paintings of saryan. an edition of these incredibly beautiful problems has long been a bibliographic rarity. it was published under the title problems and solutions of vardapet [1] anania of shirak, armenian mathematician of the seventh century (translated and published by i. a. orbeli, petrograd, 1918). the abundance of close observations and wide-ranging information about the way of life and customs of that remote epoch when anania of shirak lived and worked have actually rendered a disservice to his problem book. for many years the book was known only to researchers in the humanities--specialists in armenian history who jealously guarded their treasure and wouldn't let just anyone see it. even now, after research by k. p. patkanov, the learned monk father kaloust, j.i. orbeli, a. abramyan, v. k. chaloyan, and others has brought the works of anania of shirak to light in scholarly circles, the general reader remains ignorant of the very existence of this remarkable problem book. vardapet anania of shirak once fell in love with the art of calculation, i thought that no philosophical notion can be constructed without number, considering it the mother of all wisdom. --anania of shirak among ancient armenian thinkers, vardapet anania of shirak stands out because of the breadth of his interests and the unique mathematical orientation of his work. some of his works have been preserved. in addition to the problems and solutions, the following tracts have found a special place in the estimation of scholars: on weights and measures, cosmography and calendrical theory, and armenian geography of the seventh century a.d. (the authorship of the last work was long attributed to another outstanding thinker of ancient armenia, movses of khoren). in his autobiography, anania of shirak has this to say about himself: i, anania of shirak, having studied all the science of our armenian land and having learned the holy scripture intimately, in the expression of the psalmist, \"every day i illuminated the eyes of my mind.\" feeling myself lacking in the art of calculation, i came to the conclusion that it is fruitless to study philosophy, the mother of all sciences, without number. i could find in armenia neither a man versed in philosophy nor books that explained the sciences. i therefore went to greece and met in theodosiople a man named iliazar who was well versed in ecclesiastical works. he told me that in forth armenia [2] there lived a famous mathematician, christosatur. i went this person and spent six months with him. but soon i noticed that christosatur was a master not of all science but only of certain fragmentary facts. i then went to constantinople, where i met acquaintances who told me: \"why did you go so far, when much closer to us, in trebizon, on the coast of pontus [3] lives the byzantine vardapet tyukhik. he is full of wisdom, is known to kings, and knows armenian literature.\" i asked them how they knew this. they answered: \"we saw ourselves that many people traveled long distances to become pupils of so learned a man. indeed the archdeacon of the patriarchate of constantinople, philagrus, traveled with us, bringing many young persons to become pupils of tyukhik.\" when i heard this, i expressed my gratitude to god, who had quenched the thirst of his slave. i went to tyukhik at the monastery of st. eugene and explained why i he sent you to learn and to transplant science in the domain of st. gregory; i am glad that all your country will learn from me. i myself lived in armenia for many years as a youth. ignorance reigned there.\" vardapet tyukhik loved me as a son and shared all his thoughts with me. the lord bestowed upon me his blessing: i completely assimilated the science of number, and with such success that my fellow students at the king's court began to envy me. i spent eight years with tyukhik and studied many books that had not been translated into our language. for the vardapet had an innumerable collection of books: secret and explicit, ecclesiastical and pagan, books on art, history, and medicine, books of chronologies. why enumerate them by title? in a word, there is no book that tyukhik did not have. and he had such a gift from the holy spirit for translating that when he sat down to translate something from the greek into armenian, he did not struggle as other translators did, and the translation read as if the work were written in that language originally. tyukhik told me how he had achieved such vast erudition and how he had learned the armenian language. \"when i was young,\" he said, \"i lived in trebizon, at the court of the military chief ioannus patricus, and for a long time, up to the accession of mauritius to the throne i served as a military man in armenia and learned your language and literature. during one attack by persian troops on the greeks, i was wounded and escaped to antioch. i lost all my possessions. praying to the lord to heal my wounds, i made a promise: \"if you prolong my life, i shall dedicate it not to accumulating perishable treasures but to collecting treasures of knowledge.\" and the lord heard my prayers. after i recovered i went to jerusalem, and from there to alexandria and rome. upon returning to constantinople, i met a famous philosopher from athens and studied with him for many years. after that i returned to my homeland and began to teach and instruct my people.\" after some years that philosopher died. not finding a replacement for him, the king and his courtiers sent for tyukhik and invited him to assume the teacher's position. tyukhik, citing the promise he made to god not to move far from the city, turned down the offer. but because of his wide leaning, people came streaming from all countries to study with him. and i, the most insignificant of all armenians, having learned from him this powerful science, desired by kings, brought it to our country, supported by no one, obligated only to my own industry, god's help, and the prayers of the blessed educator. and no one thanked me for my efforts. problems and solutions a half and one sixth and one nine-ninth of all the books were printed on verge'; one fifth and one two-hundred-eighty-fifth--on rag paper; one forty-fifth and one eight-hundred-fifty-fifth--on vellum, and forty-five inscribed copies--on dutch paper. and so, find how many copies were printed in all. --imitation of anania of shirak a latin proverb says habent sua fata libelli (\"books have their own fate\"). the fate of problems and solutions by anania of shirak is quite amazing. the manuscripts of anania's book were preserved only because, according to armenian historians, \"in ancient and medieval armenia manuscripts were guarded from invaders, like weapons, and cherished, like one's own children.\" biding their time, the manuscripts lay in the matenadaran, a renowned depository of ancient manuscripts (now the mesrop mashtots institute of ancient manuscripts). and its hour finally arrived. in 1896 the learned monk father kaloust used two manuscripts to publish the problem book, supplementing it with an introduction and commentary. in 1918 the book was translated into russian, edited, annotated, and typeset by iosef orbeli, a prominent scholar (and later a member of the academy of sciences of the ussr). in the translator's words, the problems of anania are \"amusing, full of life, and simple.\" orbeli goes on to say: \"the subjects of the problems are generally taken from everyday life. the scene is predominantly his homeland shirak and the surrounding countryside, and the dramatis personae, if they are named, are the local princes--the kamsarakans, including nersekh, who was a contemporary of anania.\" like other ancient authors, anania of shirak used only \"aliquots\" -- that is, fractions with a numerator of 1. when it is necessary to write fractions with numerators other than 1, one has to represent it as a sum of aliquots (see the epigraph above). like any true work of art, the problems of anania suffer terribly in the retelling. you have to read the originals (albeit in translation) in their full glory. so let's open anania's problem book--a gift from across the ages. problems 1 and 8 relate to the armenian uprising against the persians in a.d. 572. problem 1 my father told me the following story. during the famous wars between the armenians and the persians, prince zaurak kamsarakan performed extraordinary heroic deeds. three times in a single month he attacked the persian troops. the first time, he struck down half of the persian army. the second time, pursuing the persians, he slaughtered one fourth of the soldiers. the third time, he destroyed one eleventh of the persian army. the persians who were still alive, numbering two hundred eighty, fled to nakhichevan. and so, from this remainder, find how many persian soldiers there were before the massacre. problem 8 during the famous armenian uprising against the persians, when zaurak kamsarakan killed suren, one of the armenian azats[4] sent an envoy to the persian king to report the baleful news. the envoy covered fifty miles in a day. fifteen days later, when he learned of this, zaurak kamsarakan sent riders in pursuit to bring the envoy back. the riders covered eighty miles in a day. and so, find how many days it took them to catch the envoy. problem 18 mentions vessels made of varying amounts of metal. in the russian translation, they are all called \"dishes.\" but in the original armenian, according to orbeli's note, the dishes in the first and second instances are called mesur, and in the third instance scutel. scutel is a common armenian word, but mesur had not been encountered in armenian literature before anania's problems and solutions. problem 18 there was a tray in my house. i melted it down and made other vessels from the metal. from one third i made a mesur; from one fourth, another mesur; from one fifth, two goblets; from one sixth, two scutels; and from two hundred ten drams, i made a bowl. and now, find the weight of the tray. several of the problems reflect the richness of the caucasian fauna in anania's time -- for instance, problem 7. problem 7 once i was in marmet, the capital of the kamsarakans. strolling along the bank of the river akhuryan, i saw a school of fish and ordered that a net be cast. we caught a half and a quarter of the school, and all the fishes that slipped out of the net ended up in a creel. when i looked in the creel, i found forty-five fishes. and now, find how many fishes here were in all. the temptation is great to present all 24 problems. but i'll restrain myself and offer you just one more. problem 20 provides some interesting information about the wild animals that inhabited armenia at one time but now extinct for so long that there is no mention of them even in zoological reference books. the wild donkey, according to the generally accepted view, never roamed the armenian lands. yet anania of shirak offers evidence to the contrary . problem 20 the hunting preserve of nersekh kamsarakan, ter[5] of shirak and asharunik, was at the base of the mountain called artin. one night great herds of wild donkey entered the preserve. the hunters could not cope with the donkeys and, running to the village of talin, told nersekh about them. when he arrived with his brothers and azats and entered the preserve, they began killing the wild beasts. half of the animals were caught in traps, one fourth were killed by arrows. the young, which constituted one twelfth of all the animals, were caught alive, and three hundred sixty wild donkeys were killed by spears. and so, find how many beasts there were at the start of this massacre. \"set in type by me, iosef orbeli\" his biography could not be squeezed into the framework of a bibliography. -- k uzbashyan, academician iosef abgarovich orbeli anyone who is lucky enough to hold a copy (1/n of the small printing--n is the solution to the epigraph in the previous section) of the russian translation of anania of shirak's problems and solutions, a thin book with yellowed pages, has probably noticed the variety of the fonts, the elegance of the borders, and the high quality of the design, printing, and binding. such great attention to detail is characteristic of works that fulfill a requirement for a degree in bookmaking. and this problem book was indeed a kind of diploma attesting to the professional maturity of the man who created it. an advertisement at the end of the book reads: \"this book was typeset in december 1917 at the printing offices of the russian academy of sciences by me, iosef orbeli; the text was also proofread, laid out, and decorated with borders by me. various circumstances prevented me from carrying this project to the end; the final pages of the book were typeset by m. strolman.\" typesetting was neither the first nor the only profession of the renowned orientalist iosef orbeli, who later became the director of the hermitage museum in leningrad. he was also a cabinetmaker and a locksmith. orbeli had already become acquainted with the famous academic printing house typis academiae, founded in 1728 and known all over the scientific world for its rich collection of fonts and its virtuoso typesetters. in preparing to publish the corpus of ancient inscriptions preserved on the walls of armenian churches, orbeli found it necessary to create a new font that would preserve the unique signs and ligatures. this complicated work was done by m. g. strolman. (unfortunately the entire set of letters was destroyed during the blockade of leningrad in world war ii.) when orbeli came to the printing offices of the academy of sciences, times were hard. the only way to publish the newly translated problems of anania was for orbeli to learn typesetting (he had always been attracted to the printer's craft). in 1922 orbeli became the director of printing at the academy of sciences. even after he retired, he remained a tireless champion of russian academic typography. back to earth this book by definition does not exhaust all the most important works in this domain. the editor hopes that those who are guilty of this incompleteness will read these lines and, stung by shame, will work up, if not a collection like this, at least a monograph. --v. bonch-bruyevich introduction to the russian translation of solid-body symmetry by r. knox and a. gold let's imagine a time when space flight is an everyday thing, and high schoolers will spend their breaks as astronauts-in training in the perelman crater on the far side of the moon. maybe one of the space travelers will take this very copy of quantum, and another, looking over her shoulder, will read this article and say to himself: \"this anania from shirak seems like a pretty interesting guy. when i get home i'll try to find his problems.\" good luck, my young friend! anania is sure to entertain you. perhaps by then there will be more than n copies of his timeless problems and solutions. and we can hope they will be as lovingly printed as the masterpieces created by iosef orbeli. [1] vardapet (or vartabed) means teacher or learned man in armenian.

            "ben, since you're obviously adept enough to understand how the trackball works, the only thing short of repairing it that i can think of is a thorough cleaning of all the parts, and then checking for the proper placement of the little blue rollers. since they aren't fixed in position on their stainless steel pins, you might try sliding them into a slightly different position. on my powerbook 100, i can slide them almost completely out of contact with the trackball. in fact, one of the notes from sumex on fixing the trackball advocates sliding the roller so that its _edge_ contacts the ball, not the center cylindrical area. i've done this with my pb100, and it does seem to improve the feel, but needs to be adjusted from time to time. i just popped open one of our office's pb170s, and while there isn't as much latitude for movement, one could still adjust the roller slightly. if your pb140 is the same it might help. i would suspect the most likely culprit to be a slippery blue roller. if you can take it out, clean it with a mild soapy solution, or isopropyl alcohol. also, be sure the ball is grease-free. if you drop the ball in minus the retaining ring, roll the ball and see if it is actually causing the axle to spin. if all this still doesn't solve it, then maybe a new one is in order. :-( it could be an electrical connection, in which case replacement would be necessary. but my experience with both mice and trackballs has been that dirt has been the normal problem, not an electrical malfunction. hope this helps, murray",

            "what do you mean by omnipotent here? do you mean by \"omnipotent\" that god should be able to do anything/everything? this creates a self-contradictory definition of omnipotence which is effectively useless. to be descriptive, omnipotence must mean \"being all-powerful\" and not \"being able to do anything/everything\". let me illustrate by analogy. suppose the united states were the only nuclear power on earth. suppose further that the us military could not effectively be countered by any nation or group of nations. the us has the power to go into any country at any time for any reason to straighten things out as the leaders of the us see fit. the us would be militarily \"omnipotent\". but suppose further that the us holds to a doctrine/philosophy of not interfering in the internal affairs of any nation, such as the current civil war in the former yugoslavian states. technically (in this scenario) the us would have the power to unilaterally go into yugoslavia and straighten out the mess. but effectively the us could not intervene without violating its own policy of non-interference. if the policy of non-interference were held to strongly enough, then there would never be a question that it would ever be violated. effectively, the us would be limited in what it could actually do, although it had the power to do \"whatever it wanted\". the us would simply \"never want to interfere\" for such an idea would be beyond the consideration of its leaders given such an inviolate non-interference policy. god is effectively limited in the same sense. he is all powerful, but he cannot use his power in a way that would violate the essence of what he, himself is. i hope this helps to clear up some of the misunderstanding concerning omnipotence. regards,",

            "would you say the same thing about the dodgers in '65 or '66? true, cone is probably as good as drysdale, and they have no koufax, but still, these teams were winning with home run leaders who had very bad totals, with lots of low-scoring games, etc. and they didn't use relievers, whereas jeff montgomery is having a super season for them. that being said, i still picked them 5th or so, but i think a superb pitching team can win if they have enough hitting. there's more of a chance of that, i think, than of a team with tremendous hitting but no pitching. at least, to me. i wonder, though - which one do you people think would do better - a team with johnson, koufax in his prime, seaver, carlton, and young, in no real order, as the starters, with sutter, fingers, and lyle in the bullpen, but with a puny offense (assuming good defense, like mazeroski, maranville, etc.) or a team with poor pitching, but with an offense of cobb, carew, ruth, gehrig, mays, schmidt, wagner, and bench - again,you pick the order. i would postulate that the pitching one would be several games better by seasons' end. even the best hitters can succeed only 2/5 of the time in their best years, but a great pitcher can throw lots of shutouts - taking all the players in their prime, they might throw 50 shutouts in a year. and all the offense would have to do is get 1 run across. i wonder if someone with stratomatic or something could plug such all- time teams into a regular season, have it played, and report the results i would love to see that.",

            "yes - everyone seems to be in agreement that the yankees are finally moving in the right direction. they should finish over .500 this year and maybe even be in the pennent race in august. however, i would take back a few moves: 1. the jim abbott trade. i think abbott is not only an inspirational person, but a great pitcher also. he could win the cy young this year, but he won't because the right side of the yanks infield isn't good enough. so why was this not a good trade? jt snow. how many rookies have been able to step in and immediately have the impact that he has had so far on the angels? i know it's early, but if you've seen this kid hit, field or talk you can just tell that he is going to be a tremendous player. the yanks should have kept him. what about mattingly, you ask? well - it's great that the yanks have taken care of him and remained loyal, but he's 10 years older than snow and just doesn't have the same bat speed as before his back injury. it's a shame, but as a yankee fan who wants to see the *best* yankee team, i'd take snow over mattingly at first. the yanks also gave up two promising propects with snow for abbott. besides, with domingo jean, brien taylor, wickman, militello, and sterling hitchcock, they are just loaded with propects. i know abbotts only 26, but this was too much to give up. i believe george forced this trade because he believes (and he's right) that abbott will be a big hit in ny. however, i'd like to see the yankees build a baseball team, not an amusement show. 2. wade boggs. i live in boston and like wade a lot. but, his career is winding down and i would rather see the yanks start to develop a long term solution (i.e. hensley muelins, russ davis, velarde?). besides, wade just doesn't have any range. what a shame about charlie hayes, huh? 3. spike owen. see wade boggs. i'd much rather see them develop dave silvestri or whoever. wade and spike next to each other in the infield is going to raise the yankee staff era 1/2 point. and these guys are on the down sides of their careers. 4. danny tartabull. yes - he's put up some tremendous numbers and it's nice to think about what he could do if he were ever healthy all year. but he never is. we should expect 120 games max out of him. meanwhile, gerald williams is playing at columbus and paul o'neil is playing left field! i believe o'neil led nl outfielders in assists last year - and tartabull is a poor defensive outfielder. what i'm basically getting at is the yanks are moving in the right direction but are not ready to win a pennent this year. they should (at the gm level) be planning for a 1994 or 1995 world series. this means getting the younger players experience in the majors now so they will be ready in a year or two. i'm afraid that all this stuff wreaks of george steinbrenner. certainly, the boggs deal was all george. it looks like george is planning the right mix of veterans and young players to win a world series now. the veterans are always available and can be added at any time (like boston did this year). develop the young players first, then add the one or two veterans (or in the yankees case, just keep them). let's all us yankee fans hope that george doesn't dismantle the terrific job stick and company have done building the yankee organization back into one of respect. i'm really afraid that he will trade whoever it takes to patch holes today (relief pitching for example). george must realize that the yankees rebuilding process is still one or two years away. have patience george and we will all enjoy the future. fire bucky and trade the kids and it's baseball hell for all loyal yankee fans for a long time!",

registered trademark of audio books, inc., a texas corporation, which originally produced this tape recording. reproduced under open license granted by audio books, inc. ----------------------------------------------------------------- this is the dr. beter audio letter(r), 1629 k st. nw, washington, dc 20006. hello, my friends, this is dr. beter. today is april 30, 1982, and this is my audio letter(r) no. 74. it's now been almost one month since war broke out in the south atlantic. on the surface it seems that it's only a dispute between argentina and great britain over the barren, wind-swept falkland islands and south georgia island. in reality, it's far more than that. the so-called falklands crisis is just the visible tip of a giant military operation. during this month of april 1982, fierce naval battles have taken place--not only in the south atlantic but also in the south pacific. up to now most of the hostilities have been kept under wraps by wartime censorship on all sides. but as i say these words, the naval war in the southern hemisphere is about to come to the surface. beginning today, april 30, a total naval and air blockade of the falklands by the royal navy has begun. at the same time a counterblockade has been declared by argentina in the same area. to be effective, a blockade must be imposed over a period of time, but the royal navy does not have that much time. winter is coming on in the south atlantic, and the british supply lines are overextended. having come this far, her majesty's navy cannot simply drop the blockade and sail away in a few weeks time without drawing blood from argentina. as a result the british will be forced to undertake military operations very soon no matter how risky they may be. there is also another reason why the royal navy now has no choice but to engage the argentine forces in combat. that reason, my friends, is that the royal navy has already suffered losses in secret combat this month. up to this moment there will be no way to explain away the damage which has been sustained by the british fleet. only when publicly admitted fighting erupts will the british dare to admit that they have suffered battle losses. to obtain that cover story, the british have no choice but to sail into combat; but in doing so, they will be risking even heavier losses on top of those already sustained. in short, my friends, her majesty's navy has sailed into a trap. the events now unfolding in the south atlantic carry strange, ironic echoes of the past. for weeks now we've been hearing countless commentators referring to the british task force as an \"armada\" (quote). the british of all people ought to be very uneasy with that description. the original spanish armada 400 years ago was renowned as a seemingly invincible fighting force, but it came to grief in a naval disaster so complete that it changed the course of history--and it was none other than the english navy that destroyed the spanish armada. the original spanish armada put to sea in 1588 during the reign of england's queen elizabeth i. the armada was an invasion fleet carrying thousands of crack fighting men to invade england. they were met by the daring sea dogs of sir francis drake. drake and his small, fast ships turned the tables on the spanish armada by changing the rules of battle. the english fleet was equipped with new longer-range guns, and it stayed upwind and out of reach. from there the english pounded, smashed, and shattered the big ships of the mighty armada. when it was all over, barely half the spanish fleet was left to limp back to port. drake's defeat of the spanish armada was a shock to the world. it opened the door for england under queen elizabeth i to start its expansion into a truly global empire. today, 400 years later, history seems to have come full circle. queen elizabeth ii is witnessing the dismantling of the world empire whose heyday began under queen elizabeth i, and now the cultures of england and of spain are once again in confrontation. once again a so-called armada is preparing for invasion, but this time the armada is british, not spanish. four hundred years ago sir francis drake was the hero of the day; today, the ghost of francis drake is once again on the scene. the south atlantic war zone is at the eastern end of the drake passage around the southern tip of south america. the defeat of the spanish armada four centuries ago broke the back of spain's naval supremacy, and now the defeat of the new british armada may well break the back of what remains of the once glorious royal navy. my three special topics for this audio letter are: topic #1--the military secret of south georgia island topic #2--the secret naval war of the southern hemisphere topic #3--the rockefeller fear campaign against nuclear war. topic #1--when the falkland islands crisis began early this month it looked at first like a tempest in a teapot. for a century and a half since 1833, the islands have been controlled by great britain. during that entire time, british sovereignty over the falklands has been disputed by argentina. there have been countless threats by argentina to seize the islands, which it calls the malvinas, but the threats have always come to nothing in the past and britain has never even gotten very worried about them. the islands are four times as distant from argentina as cuba is from the united states, and they are not much of a prize. after 150 years of occupancy, the falklands are home to fewer than 2,000 british settlers and a lot of sheep. in short, the remote falkland islands hardly look like something to fight over, and yet here we are watching another crisis take place. we are watching as war erupts between great britain and argentina. the thatcher government is acting as if it has forgotten all about its usual preoccupation with the soviet threat at nato's doorstep. instead, britain is throwing almost everything it's got at argentina---aircraft carriers, cruisers, destroyers, submarines, assault ships--you name it. luxury cruise ships have even been commissioned and turned into troop carriers overnight. wave after wave of additional assault troops have been activated and sent to join the fleet even after it sailed. ships and submarines have been pulled off station from normal nato duty and sent to reinforce the task force. the initial 40-ship force has grown steadily over the past several weeks into an armada numbering over 70. over two-thirds of the entire royal navy has already been deployed to the south atlantic off argentina. watching all this, a lot of people are asking: what's this fight really all about? the most popular answer suggested in the major media is \"oil.\" vast deposits of oil are known to exist under the continental shelf between argentina and the falklands, but that has been known for nearly 10 years. in no way does it explain the timing of the sudden military offensive by argentina this month, and oil explains even less about the argentine seizure of south georgia island. south georgia island is 800 miles east of the falklands with no known oil deposits anywhere near it; and compared to south georgia, the falklands are an island paradise. south georgia island is covered with rugged mountains, treacherous valleys, glaciers, and semi-permanent snow. most of it is uninhabitable. on top of all that, argentina has absolutely no legal or historical claim to south georgia island. in that respect it stands in sharp contrast to the falklands. in the early 1830s the falklands were occupied for a while by argentine colonists. in 1833 the british expelled them and took over the island. for that and other historical reasons, argentina argues that the falklands really belong to argentina, not britain. but no such argument is possible for south georgia island. it has always been controlled by britain, never by argentina or spain. the argentine seizure of south georgia island looks even more unreasonable from a military point of view. argentina's leaders are military men and they think in military terms. they were well aware ahead of time that far-off south georgia island could not possibly be held for long. by seizing it they were setting themselves up to absorb a military defeat, as the island was retaken by britain. so the question is: why did argentina's military junta bother with the seemingly worthless south georgia island at all? my friends, the answers to all these questions are military, not political or economic. south georgia island possesses an enormous military secret. it's a giant underground installation buried under the mountains at the northwest end of the island. the real reason for the so-called falkland crisis is this secret installation, together with two other similar installations which i will describe shortly. the secret military complexes have been in existence for many years; they are not new. what is new is the accelerated nuclear war timetable of the american bolshevik war planners here in washington. for the past two months i've been reporting the details of this new war plan to you as quickly as i can obtain and verify them. the plan calls for nuclear war one to erupt by september of this year 1982!! it is this fast-approaching nuclear war threat that caused the so-called falklands crisis to erupt now. what is going on now is a coordinated effort to spoil part of the bolshevik grand strategy for the coming nuclear war. the mutual enemies of the american bolsheviks here--namely, the rockefeller cartel--and russia's new rulers in the kremlin are behind the present crisis. they are trying to ruin phase #3 of the \"project z\" war plan which i revealed last month. that phase is to be world domination by the american bolsheviks after both russia and the united states have been destroyed in nuclear war one. as i mentioned last month, the key to this plan is the existence of secret weapons stockpiles in various places around the world. the american bolshevik military planners here in america are working with other bolshevik agents in key military positions of other countries to set off war. having done that, they intend to ride out the nuclear holocaust they have caused, safe and cozy in government war bunkers! when the warring nations finally lie smoldering and exhausted, the bolsheviks will leave the shattered remains of their host countries. they will rendezvous at the secret weapons installations and bring their weapons into the open. they will confront the world with the only remaining fresh, up-to-date, powerful military force on earth; and using that military power, they will become the undisputed rulers of the world--that is, they plan to do all this, and they plan to pave the way for world domination very soon by setting off nuclear war one in a matter of months. the rockefeller cartel and russia's new anti-bolshevik rulers are working together in a race against time to try to head off the bolshevik war plan. last month i mentioned that the bolsheviks here are benefitting from war preparations which were started by the rockefellers long ago. it has only been about three years since the rockefellers were dislodged as the prime movers of the united states government by the bolsheviks. since that time the united states government has been a house divided, torn by internal power struggles between rival bolshevik and rockefeller factions. but before that, the united states had been dominated for decades both economically and politically by the four rockefeller brothers. in 1961 the brothers launched a new long-range plan for world domination. it was a two-prong strategy, half visible and half secret, which i first described long ago in audio letter no. 28. it was a plan for the united states to arm to the teeth in secret while appearing to disarm gradually. without repeating all the details, the basic idea was grandiose yet simple. by deliberately appearing weak, the rockefeller-controlled united states would maneuver itself into a nuclear war with russia. then the secret weapons, including superweapons, would be unleashed to smash russia and take over the world. when they set the grand plan in motion in 1961, the rockefeller brothers were looking ahead to a nuclear war by the late 1970s. their military analysts concluded very early that the war being planned would have very different effects on the northern and southern hemispheres. both superpowers, the united states and the soviet union, are located well up in the northern hemisphere; so are the other full-fledged nuclear powers--great britain, france, red china, and india. by contrast, the strategic targets for nuclear war in the southern hemisphere are relatively few and far between. in other words, it was expected that the coming nuclear war would be essentially a northern hemisphere war. in an all-out nuclear holocaust it is known that serious radioactive fallout will gradually spread to affect even areas not initially hit by war. but there are limits to how far the war clouds can spread. it was discovered long ago that there is very little mixing between the air of the northern and southern hemispheres. in the northern half of our planet, cold air from the north pole works its way southward towards the equator, then it works its way back to the north as warm air. a mirror image of this process takes up the southern half of the planet. northern and southern hemisphere air meet in the equatorial zone, but very little of the air changes places. the military conclusion, my friends, is this: the coming nuclear war could ruin large areas of the northern hemisphere for generations to come; but if the calculations are right, the southern hemisphere could escape virtually unaffected by the war. this was music to the ears of the four rockefeller brothers. a quick look at the globe of the world shows why. the rockefeller cartel has dominated latin america ever since world war ii. as i discussed in my very first monthly audio letter, nelson rockefeller solidified the cartel grip on latin america during the war. he accomplished this as so-called \"coordinator of hemispheric defense\" for then-president franklin d. roosevelt. so that takes care of the south american continent and its natural resources. then there is the african continent. there, too, rockefeller control was already in effect over wide areas of black africa, especially south of the equator. all this was thanks to the efforts of john d. rockefeller iii, as i detailed in audio letter no. 36. looking around the globe, the most important remaining land masses from the standpoint of world domination are australia and new zealand. thanks to world war ii, both were wide open to the rockefellers. the rockefeller brothers decided to establish secret military installations in the southern hemisphere for use after the coming war. by this means they expected to become the masters of the surviving southern half of planet earth after the northern hemisphere war. then, as the northern hemisphere gradually recovered from the nuclear holocaust, the rockefeller empire would be able to pick up the pieces. in this way the third generation rockefeller brothers expected their family dynasty to inherit the earth. in order to control the southern hemisphere militarily after the war, some means would have to be available to project military power onto any land mass. for example, revolts against rockefeller domination would require troops--not a blast from the beam weapons on the moon. the most critical factor for postwar military domination of the world was found to be a navy. a minimum of two secret naval fleets would be required--one based in the south atlantic, the other in the south pacific. since the reserve naval fleets were to be kept secret until after the northern hemisphere nuclear war, they could not be built in existing shipyards. new construction facilities had to be built and they had to be hidden. to hide an entire shipyard is no small task; they take up a lot of space. on top of that, it was essential that the ships remain hidden after they were built. the best way to achieve that was to combine the shipyard and naval base into one over-all secret installation. finally, the secret naval installation had to be invulnerable to nuclear attack; otherwise if its existence were ever discovered prematurely, the secret navy might be wiped out. the combined requirements for secrecy, space, and protection against attack were formidable; but one day in 1959, while all these plans were still in the early stages of development, the answer presented itself. during a so-called banking trip to sweden, david rockefeller was given a tour of a unique hidden naval port. the port is hollowed out from solid granite cliffs which come right down to the water. the entrance to the port is a gigantic hole in the side of the cliff which can be sealed off with enormous steel doors. inside this big doorway on the water a huge cavity has been hollowed out to accommodate ships. the rockefeller brothers and their military adviser decided that a bigger, more secret, better protected version of the swedish hidden port was just what they wanted. a survey of candidate sites was then initiated. the site survey covered coastal areas throughout the southern hemisphere. many areas were rejected very quickly because the topography was wrong. other areas were rejected because they were too close to the equator. still others had to be ruled out because there were too many people living nearby, making the desired level of secrecy impossible. finally, it was essential that the sites chosen for the secret naval installations be totally secure politically. at last the sites for the secret naval installations were selected. in the south pacific, extreme southern new zealand was selected. this is what i was alluding to in audio letter no. 71 three months ago when i called attention to new zealand's extreme importance in the coming war. in order to obtain the necessary space, the secret new zealand naval installation had to be divided up into two sites located close together. one is at the extreme southwest tip of south island where the mountain range known as the southern alps comes down virtually to the water's edge. the other part of the installation is built into the northwest tip of stewart island, which is off the tip of south island. the stewart island facility is hollowed out within a rise known as mt. anglem. the new zealand location met all the requirements. ever since world war ii the government of new zealand has been tied even closer to the united states than to great britain. the location is far from the equator, and the installations are buried deep under mountains, protected from nuclear attack. they are also too deep to be reached by particle-beam attacks, and the new zealand site is well situated to command the entire south pacific. in the south atlantic an even more perfect site was found. that site, my friends, is south georgia island. it is located perfectly for naval domination of the entire south atlantic. the tall, rugged mountains provided a perfect location for the secret installation at the northwest tip of the 100-mile long island. it is controlled by great britain whose government, like that of new zealand, was willing to cooperate; and south georgia island was virtually uninhabited except for a whaling station on the northeast coast. the whaling station was some 50 miles away from the secret new installation which was being built, but britain took no chances. in 1965 the whaling station was closed down. since that time there have been no inhabitants on south georgia island except for a few dozen alleged antarctic scientists. construction of the secret naval facilities--two in new zealand, one on south georgia island--began in the early 1960's. the techniques were adapted from those used previously to build other large underground facilities, such as the norad installation inside cheyenne mountain, colorado; however these techniques were adapted in radically new ways to achieve construction access directly from the sea instead of overland. in this way, the sheltering mountain was left undisturbed in appearance both during and after construction. the cuts in the mountain side which were necessary to let ships in and out were kept as small as possible and were well camouflaged. like the swedish hidden naval port arrangement, the entrances to the secret installations can be sealed up. when sealed, the entrance is virtually impossible to detect unless you know exactly where it is; and unlike most large construction projects, there are no tailings or piles of leftover rock lying around to attract attention. the man-made caverns which house the secret naval installations are enormous, but all the rock and debris was disposed of at sea. once the secret naval facilities were built, they had to be outfitted for ship construction and docksite storage. the fake disarmament of the united states during the 1960s contributed greatly to this task. from 1961 to 1968 one man played a pivotal role in this elaborate rockefeller scheme. he was then-secretary of defense robert mcnamara. all through the 60's mcnamara presided over the public paring back of america's visible military power. this included the closing down and dismantling of entire shipyards. what we were not told was where all that shipyard equipment went afterwards. where it went, my friends, was to the new secret installations which were being outfitted in new zealand and south georgia island! the secret naval installations have been used as duplication facilities to reproduce certain ships and submarines designed and built here in the united states. as defense secretary caspar weinberger told congress recently, it is cheaper to build two ships at a time. that is especially true if the second ship is an exact duplicate of the first. this has become even more true in recent years through the use of computerized manufacturing techniques. the secret naval fleets which have been built at the secret installations are made up of duplicates--exact duplicates of certain other ships and submarines. they are all nuclear powered--nuclear \"subs\"; nuclear cruisers; nuclear destroyers; and yes, nuclear aircraft carriers, three of them. a secret twin was built for the u.s.s. nimitz, for the u.s.s. eisenhower, and for the newly-launched u.s.s. carl vincent. all have been financed through the gigantic cost overruns, so called, that we constantly hear about in the defense department; and all three carriers have been provided with a full complement of aircraft whose manufacture was financed the same way! the ships of the secret american bolshevik naval fleets are all duplicates of other nuclear-powered vessels. even so, the secret naval ships possess one key difference. last month i revealed that the so-called \"stealth program\" has succeeded in developing a kind of electromagnetic invisibility shield. this technique makes an object invisible from a distance by distorting light waves in its vicinity. a whole new fleet of phantom war-planes are now going into crash production that use this principle; and, my friends, all of the secret american bolshevik navy ships have already been outfitted with similar stealth-field equipment! the stealth principle is actually easier to apply to ships than to airplanes because there is more room for the powerful equipment that generates the field. after nuclear war one, the secret stealth navy of the american bolsheviks would be light years ahead of any other navy left on earth. it would be perfect for the intended role of world domination. the rockefellers set it all in motion long ago, my friends, but three years ago they lost control of the united states military. now it's the american bolsheviks who are in control, and they are bent on war. these secret naval installations have precipitated what is being called the \"falklands crisis.\" topic #2--in audio letter(r) no. 73 last month i described \"project z\", the new bolshevik three-phase strategy for nuclear war one. an elite group of american bolshevik military planners here are flushing out the plan right now at a secret war-room here in washington. it's a plan by which the united states will strike the first nuclear blow, followed by all-out thermonuclear war with russia. having set off the holocaust, the bolsheviks here and in certain other countries plan to rise it out safe in comfortable war bunkers. finally after nuclear war one fizzles out in stalemate, they plan to leave behind the ashes of the united states and her allies. activating phase #3 of their grand strategy, they plan to unveil their secret weapons, especially their secret naval fleets. with these they plan to conquer and rule what is left of the world. the united states as we know it will be dead and gone; but in the eyes of the bolsheviks themselves, this outcome will constitute victory. up to now the nuclear war timetable which i first revealed two months ago is still on track. they are still shooting for nuclear war to begin by september of this year 1982! time is fast running out. the bolsheviks here are sprinting as fast as they can toward war; but, my friends, the bolsheviks are not the only runners in this race. they have two deadly enemies, both of whom are equally determined to trip up the bolsheviks. one enemy of the bolsheviks here is the rockefeller cartel; the other enemy is the new anti-bolshevik ruling clique in russia; and now these two mutual enemies of the bolsheviks are pooling their efforts in certain ways. in audio letter no. 71 three months ago i reported that a limited, new anti-bolshevik coalition was in the works between the rockefeller cartel and the russians. the january 26 meeting between haig and gromyko in geneva, switzerland, was a turning point in the formation of this coalition. it is now a reality, and is responsible for the so-called \"falkland crisis\" now dominating the headlines. it should be emphasized that this new relationship between the rockefeller cartel and russia falls far short of a true alliance. they have very major disputes to be settled between them, but for the time being they have called a truce between themselves to deal with their mutual deadly enemy--the bolsheviks here in america. the first priority of the russians and the rockefellers is to slow down the bolshevik preparations for imminent nuclear war. if they can do that, time is on the side of the rockefeller cartel in certain political movements which i discussed last summer in audio letter no. 67. a slow-down in the nuclear war timetable will also give more breathing space for additional anti-bolshevik actions to be implemented. the joint rockefeller-russian planners decided by mid-february that military action against the bolsheviks was essential very quickly. no other type of action had any hope of taking effect fast enough to prevent nuclear war by the end of this summer. the exact details of the \"project z\" war plan are not known to either the rockefellers or the russians, but the general outlines are known to be as i described last month. it was decided that military action should be devised that would undermine phase #3 of the bolshevik war plan--that is, the bolshevik-controlled secret naval installations and fleets in the southern hemisphere should be attacked and crippled. by working together, the rockefeller cartel and the russians were able to devise an attack plan which neither could have carried out alone. the rockefeller group, who built and originally controlled these bases, provided detailed intelligence about the best way to attack them. the russians with their enormous military machine provided the muscle to actually carry out the attack. it was essential to devise a scheme that would enable both secret fleets in the south atlantic and south pacific to be attacked. survival intact of either fleet would leave the bolshevik war plan still workable. military analysts concluded very quickly that a direct assault on the new zealand facilities was out of the question. there was no combination of commandos, frogmen, or other military force which could possibly keep an attack secret from the outside world. any attack on the new zealand bases would set off the very war which the rockefellers and russians want to prevent. but the situation in the south atlantic was a different matter. in a way, the greatest asset of south georgia island was also its achilles' heel. the extreme isolation which protected the secrecy of the south georgia base also made a covert military assault feasible. the key lay with argentina and her long-standing claims to the falkland islands. as i mentioned in topic #1, the rockefeller cartel has dominated all of latin america for decades. cartel operatives were sent to argentina to work out a deal with the government military junta there. the historic dispute over the falkland islands was to be used to provide a ruse, a military cover, to enable the south georgia base to be attacked. the argentine generals were not told everything about the situation by any means, but they were told enough to make clear what they were to do. as an inducement to cooperate, the argentine leaders were promised handsome rewards. they were guaranteed that after the shooting was over, the falkland islands would remain in argentine hands. this guarantee included the promise of covert military assistance as needed against the royal navy. and to bolster the troubled argentine economy, it was promised that the rockefeller cartel will help develop the immense offshore oil reserves. with these combined promises of military glory and financial rewards, the argentine military junta agreed to the plan. on march 19 argentina carried out act #1 in the joint attack plan. a group of argentine scrap-metal merchants, of all things, landed at the abandoned old whaling station on south georgia island. supposedly they were there to dismantle the old buildings and cart them off to sell. while they were at it they also raised the argentine flag over the work-site. the british, always nervous about south georgia island, promptly reacted as expected. the british antarctic survey ship \"endurance\" put 22 marines ashore. they drove off the scrap merchants and tore down the argentine flag. the incident provided the desired excuse for the argentine junta to bring the simmering 150-year-old falklands dispute to a boil. from time to time in the past, argentina has claimed that south georgia is part of the falklands because it is administered that way by britain. that argument is very flimsy but it now came in very handy. it was nothing new to hear this from argentine leaders, so there was no hint of what was really afoot. during late march, argentine military forces started assembling for an assault on the falklands. \"nothing new\", thought the british high command. argentina has carried out threatening maneuvers in the past many times. it was believed that they were about to do it again; but on april 2 argentine forces did the unexpected. after many past false alarms, this time they actually invaded and seized the islands. all argentine public statements emphasized the long-standing historical claims to the falklands themselves; but just for good measure, the next day a small argentine force also seized far-off south georgia island. the force was so small that it gave the appearance initially that it was just a side show from argentina's point of view; however, the small contingent of 22 royal marines were overpowered and bundled off the island along with a group of 13 alleged scientists. that was the moment of payoff in the joint rockefeller-russian attack plan. thanks to the elaborate distraction staged by the argentine forces, a special commando team got onto the island undetected. based on the detailed rockefeller information about the base, the team moved to a location on the mountain directly above the cavernous secret base. special high-speed drilling equipment was set up by the rockefeller members of the team while the russian members concentrated on military defense. by late that evening, april 3, the military high command in london finally learned what was really taking place. the secret south georgia base was under attack by virtually the only means possible. the joint rockefeller-russian team were drilling a shaft down through the mountain toward the hollowed out cavern inside. it was only a matter of time until their drill would break through the ceiling of the giant hidden naval base. once the hole was made, the next step was obvious. the rockefeller-russian team would put a weapon of some kind through the hole. the best guess was that it would be a nerve gas. the shock waves that went through the highest levels of the british government on the evening of april 3 can hardly be described, my friends. the thatcher government, like the so-called reagan administration here in america, is bolshevik controlled. that's why margaret thatcher always says, \"me, too\" any time the reagan administration says or does anything against russia. both governments are party to the secret nuclear war plan in complete betrayal of the people of their respective countries, and on the evening of april 3 they suddenly discovered that their precious war plan was in deep, deep trouble. immediately the thatcher government started assembling a naval armada to sail for the south atlantic. haste was the order of the day. the drilling on south georgia island was proceeding around the clock. the best estimates were that the drilling would break through into the roof of the naval base in about three weeks, on or about april 24. if help did not reach south georgia by then, the secret installation might be doomed. the forces stationed at the installation itself were unable to defend themselves under the circumstances. their mighty naval ships were ships in a bottle. they did not dare open the bottle to sail out to fight because the russian commandos were armed with tactical and nuclear weapons. to open the blast-proof entrance doors would be suicide. on april 5, just two days after south georgia island was seized, some 40 naval ships began moving out of british ports. the same day lord carrington was sacked as foreign minister. he was forced to resign, my friends, because he had assisted the rockefeller attack plan by downplaying the argentine attack preparations. that same day, april 5, new zealand, the home of the other secret naval fleet, broke diplomatic relations with argentina. the two hidden new zealand facilities had been placed on \"red alert.\" as a precautionary measure, all submarines at the twin base were ordered to sea. several surface ships were already at sea undergoing \"sea trials\", but that still left seven (7) major ships inside the hidden twin naval base including one of the nuclear aircraft carriers i mentioned earlier. on that busy day of april 5, argentina's foreign minister, costa mendez, was at the united nations in new york. he was alarmed by the deployment of such a large part of the royal navy. costa mendez hurried here to washington to seek reassurances from certain officials. he got them! for the next two weeks or so the news was filled with stories about the allegedly slow movement of the british fleet while negotiations went on. that, my friends, was only a cover story. the royal navy was actually joining up and moving as rapidly as possible toward south georgia island. if the task force arrived in time to save the secret base, a major battle was likely. the official stories about \"slow movement\" of the british armada were intended to give a cushion of time for that battle. if need be, the fleet would have several days to retake south georgia island, then it could move on to arrive near the falklands on the announced schedule. in this way the crucial importance of south georgia island would be hidden and the big secret preserved. it was initially expected that advance elements of the british fleet would reach the vicinity of south georgia island within two weeks. that would have been soon enough to attack the joint rockefeller-russian commando team and stop the drilling before it was completed. but russian cosmospheres and submarines made a shambles of the plan. key advance elements of the south georgia attack contingent left ascension island early april 14, two days before it was announced officially. shortly after they did so, they ran into trouble. russian cosmospheres and attack submarines closed in on a single ship which was critical to the planned counterassault on south georgia island. the cosmospheres bombarded the bridge and combat information center of the ship with neutron radiation. in moments the ship was without any command, its communications and radar silenced. then a russian \"sub\" closed in and quickly finished off this key british ship with torpedoes. it broke apart with secondary explosions and sank rapidly. so far as is known, there were no survivors. this unexpected shock in the mid-atlantic produced two results, both important: first, it caused a slowdown in the race toward the south atlantic by the british armada. the task force had to be regrouped into a configuration better suited for an enroute defense, but that cost valuable time. public announcements from london about the progress of the fleet reflected this slowdown. the timetable for arrival on battle stations near the falklands started stretching out longer and longer. all this bought extra time for the joint commando team on south georgia island. the drilling continued. the other result of the sinking was equally important. word was flashed to the south pacific stealth navy to prepare for possible action. it was obvious that the russian navy was getting involved in the atlantic, which meant that the royal navy could be in big trouble. during the dead of night, early april 15, the seven stealth ships put to sea from their twin secret bases in southern new zealand. they deployed to a secret operational headquarters area in the antipodes islands, 450 miles southeast of new zealand. their electromagnetic shields were operating to provide protection from attack. these shields make it impossible to communicate with the outside world or even to see it, as i explained last month; but once they arrived at the antipodes, the stealth ships hooked up to buoys equipped with shielded communication cables to the island headquarters. the antipodes headquarters, in turn, was in constant touch with the south georgia base by way of a transoceanic cable around the tip of south america. the deployment of the available ships of the south pacific stealth fleet was exactly what the joint rockefeller-russian planners had hoped for. the ships had been flushed out from their essentially invulnerable hiding place in new zealand! the british ship's sinking of april 14 was also followed by other events. on april 15 the argentine navy started moving out of port. the same day, alexander haig arrived again in buenos aires. supposedly he was there as a diplomat, but in reality he was there as a general, dealing with generals. haig is the top governmental operative of the rockefeller cartel, as i have revealed in the past. he was making sure that the argentines did not get cold feet and back down at that critical moment. four days later, april 19, haig left for washington. as he boarded his plane, haig somberly told reporters, \"time is running out.\" and so it was, my friends, for the secret south georgia base. the very next day, april 20, the drill broke through into the hollowed-out cavern of the naval base. bolshevik military analysts in london had not expected that it could be completed until at least the following weekend. the british fleet was still out of range. the weapon which the commando team inserted down through the long hole was a small, compact russian neutron bomb. when it was detonated inside the confines of the huge artificial cave, the effects were devastating. the intense radiation instantly killed everyone inside the base. also the heat and blast effects of the bomb are believed to have damaged all the ships inside sufficiently to badly disable them. meanwhile, russian cosmospheres and submarines were converging on the stealth ships which were near the antipodes islands awaiting orders. from a distance, the ships were invisible to the eye due to their protective shields, which also protect against beam-weapon attack; but they were sitting ducks for the tactics which the russians employed. floating overhead, the cosmospheres located the seven ships using their psychoenergetic range-finding equipment known as prf. as i have reported in the past, there is no method known by which prf can be jammed. the cosmospheres radioed the exact locations of the ships to the attack submarines. the \"subs\" were armed with special non-homing, non-nuclear torpedoes designed to explode on impact. more sophisticated torpedoes would have been thrown off course or detonated prematurely by the protective shield of each ship; but these simple torpedoes just cruise right through each invisibility field to strike the ship and explode. within 15 minutes after the attack began, all seven bolshevik stealth ships were on their way to the bottom, and with them went their bolshevik commanders and mercenary crews collected from around the world. the south pacific action took place just after sunset local time. the time here in washington was around 2:00 p.m. april 23. that evening secretary of state haig was seen briefly in public with the new british foreign minister, francis pym. pym was wearing the artificial pseudo-smile which diplomats are taught always to display in public. but not haig. haig was grinning from ear to ear, and no wonder. the joint rockefeller-russian military operation had been a brilliant success. the secret bolshevik south atlantic fleet had been virtually wiped out, bottled up inside south georgia island; and the south pacific fleet, while not totally wiped out, had been badly crippled. by working together, the rockefeller cartel and the russians had won the secret naval war of the southern hemisphere. topic #3--as i say these words, news reports give the impression that war is about to erupt in the south atlantic, but the real war in the southern hemisphere is already over. what we are watching now is the beginning of its bloody aftermath. that aftermath is the battle for the falkland islands. they have been promised to argentina as a reward for her role in the secret war. at this moment the bolsheviks here in washington are pressing for a public announcement that the united states will side with britain. as soon as that takes place, military action will heat up fast around the falklands. britain has no choice but to fight. she has already suffered casualties which cannot be explained without a public battle; but by fighting, the bolsheviks in britain are running the risk of a humiliating and tragic defeat for the royal navy. meanwhile, the rockefeller strategists here are now concentrating on a fast-building, anti-nuclear-war campaign. on all sides now we are hearing about the so-called \"nuclear freeze movement.\" there are documentaries, articles, publicity of all kinds to sensitize us to the terrors of nuclear war. in recent months, there have even been referenda popping up on election ballots dealing with the nuclear war issue. medical doctors are banding together to warn the public about what would happen if there were a nuclear war. we are being told that all this is just popping up spontaneously. we are now 37 years into the nuclear age and nothing like this has ever gained so much momentum before, yet now we are supposed to believe that millions of americans have spontaneously gotten the same ideas at the same time. if you believe that, my friends, i give up. movements like this never, and i mean never, develop without leadership, organization, and money--and plenty of it. what we are watching is the rockefeller public relations machine at work. as i've explained in the past, the rockefeller cartel cannot afford to let a nuclear war take place. if it does, they will lose everything because they are not in a position to control it. instead, the deadly enemies of the rockefeller cartel, the bolsheviks here, will win out if there is a war; and so the rockefeller faction is now doing everything in its power to prevent a nuclear war. the present anti-nuclear-war orientation of the rockefeller cartel creates certain temporary common interests between them and russia; but as russia's new rulers know very well, this does not spring from any great moral perspective on the part of the rockefeller group. it's purely a matter of practical necessity right now for the rockefellers. the russians regard the united states as a house divided, and they are exploiting that division by working in careful ways with the rockefellers. their first priority is to rid the world of the deadly bolshevik menace of all-out, even suicidal, nuclear war; but once that is done, they know that there will be a day of reckoning with the rockefeller cartel some day. the rockefeller group is working toward a definite objective with their new anti-nuclear-war propaganda. that objective is renewed power--and power that moves them closer to their old dream of world government. the bolsheviks here have unwittingly provided fertile ground for the powerful new rockefeller antiwar campaign. under bolshevik control, the so-called reagan administration has become so hawkish that it's scaring people. the rockefeller antiwar campaign is designed to capitalize on that latent fear as a tool of power. these days the smell of war is in the air. the falklands crisis is helping to make that more intense. the rockefeller propaganda machine is now paving the way for the argument that surrender of sovereignty is the only way to avoid war. a new super-united nations of sorts is now in the works to fill the bill. it will have teeth! as presently envisioned, the new organization will be based in geneva, switzerland. the working name, though this may be changed, is the \"world nonproliferation council.\" the plan is to bring it into being as the outgrowth of nuclear nonproliferation treaties, but its true purpose will be to use fear--the fear of war--to control us all. last minute summary now it's time for my last minute summary. in this audio letter i have reported on the reasons behind the so-called falkland islands crisis. the crisis erupted because of secret bolshevik-controlled naval installations in the southern hemisphere. these have been attacked by joint action of the rockefeller cartel and the russians in an attempt to slow down the nuclear-war timetable. the attacks were successful, but the results remain to be seen. one result, though, is that the royal navy has now been drawn into a trap. britain's waterloo at sea may well be at hand. my friends, two factions are struggling for control over our united states--the rockefeller cartel and the bolsheviks. they differ in style but both seek to control us through fear. if we are ever to rise above their trickery, it must be through the power of our lord jesus christ, our only hope. as the scripture tells us, our lord \"...has not given us the spirit of fear; but of power, of love, and of a sound mind.\" we must learn to wage peace. as our lord declared long ago, \"blessed are the peacemakers: for they shall be called sons of god.\"",

            "you are making precisely one of the points i wanted to make. i fully agree with you that there is a big distinction between the *process* of science and the end result. as an end result of science, one wants to get results that are objectively verifiable. but there is nothing objective about the *process* of science. if good empirical research were done and showed that there is some merit to homeopathic remedies, this would certainly be valuable information. but it would still not mean that homeopathy qualifies as a science. this is where you and i disagree with turpin. in order to have science, one must have a theoretical structure that makes sense, not a mere collection of empirically validated random hypotheses. experiment and empirical studies are an important part of science, but they are merely the culmination of scientific research. the most important part of true scientific methodology is scientific thinking. without this, one does not have any hypotheses worth testing. (no, hypotheses do not just leap out at you after you look at enough data. nor do they simply come to you in a flash one day while you're shaving or looking out the window. at least not unless you've done a lot of really good thinking beforehand.) the difference between a nobel prize level scientist and a mediocre scientist does not lie in the quality of their empirical methodology. it depends on the quality of their thinking. it really bothers me that so many graduate students seem to believe that they are doing science merely because they are conducting empirical studies. and it bothers me even more that there are many fields, such as certain parts of psychology, where there seems to be no thinking at all, but mere studies testing ad hoc hypotheses. and i'm especially offended by russell turpin's repeated assertion that science amounts to nothing more than avoiding mistakes. simply avoiding mistakes doesn't get you anywhere. -- in the arguments between behaviorists and cognitivists, psychology seems less like a science than a collection of competing religious sects.",

            "i hope i didn't award custody, rich. i purposely used \"handle\" in order to avoid doing so - i.e., that happens to be what religions do (of course there are aberrations like \"scientific\" creationism). i used \"best\" in part to indicate that science currently has a time of it with why and who, so these domains are mostly ignored. i also attempted to be brief, which no doubt confused the matter. as an aside, for science i should have written \"how and when\". nobody seems to argue over what. seems to me that the answer would vary from individual to individual. i'm not trying to be evasive on this, but from a societal perspective, religion works. on the other hand, sometimes it is abused and misused, and many suffer, which you know. but the net result seems positive, this from the anthropological perspective on human affairs. you might call me a neo-fruedian insofar as i think the masses can't get along without religion. not that generally they are incapable; they just don't, and for myriad reasons, but the main one seems to be the promise of immortality. very seductive, that immortality. therefore it seems that theologians are better equipped than the others you mention for dispensing answers to \"who and why\". i suggest that this holds regardless of the \"truth\" in their answers to who and why simply because people believe. in the end, spiritual beliefs are just as \"real\" as scientific facts and explanation (caution to some: do not take this out of context). no. in fact, i don't think it is closed now, at least for some individuals. isn't there a group of theoretical physicists who argue that matter was created from nothing in a big bang singularity? this approach might presuppose an absence of who and why, except that it seems it could be argued that something had to be responsible for nothing? maybe that something doesn't have to be supernatural, maybe just mechanistic. but that's a tough one for people today to grasp. in any case, theory without empirical data is not explanation, but then your question does not require data. in other words, i agree that theorizing (within scientific parameters) is just as scientific as explaining. so the answer is, who and why are not closed to scientists, but i sense that science in these realms is currently very inadequate. data will be necessary for improvement, and that seems a long way off, if ever. pretty convoluted here; i hope i've made sense. i agree generally. but i prefer to put it this way - the *questions* of how, when, who and why were not open to inquiry. during the enlightenment, reason was reponsible for questioning the theological answers to how and when, and not, for the most part, who and why. science was thus born out of the naturalists' curiosity, eventually carting away the how and when while largely leaving behind the who and why. the ignorant, the selfish, the intolerant, and the arrogant, of course, still claim authority in all four domains. much obliged. funny how facts tend to muddle things, isn't it? well, i am sure there are plenty of \"scientific\" creationist \"rebuttals\" out there somewhere, even if they have to be created from nothing.

            "excerpts from netnews.talk.politics.guns: 18-apr-93 2nd amendment dead - good ! by jrm@gnv.ifas.ufl.edu excerpted from a letter i wrote a while ago: although less apparent to those who have not researched the facts, personal protection is as legitimate a reason as sport for the private citizen to own a gun. the most recent research is that of dr. gary kleck of the florida state university school of criminology.1 he found that handguns are more often used by victims to defeat crime than by criminals to commit it (645,000 vs. 580,000 respectively in this study). these figures are even more encouraging when you consider the number of crimes that never occur because of the presence of a gun in the hands of a law-abiding private citizen. in a national institute of justice study of ten state prisons across the country they found that 39% of the felons surveyed had aborted at least one crime because they believed that the intended victim was armed., and 57% agreed that \"most criminals are more worried about meeting an armed victim than they are about running into the police.\"2 one of the most heinous of crimes is that against the women of this country. it has been my recent observation that more women are purchasing handguns for defense in response to the present danger of these assaults. this should be taken as encouraging news if the events of orlando florida are any indicator. in the late 1960's the female populace was plagued with a series of brutal assaults; just the publicity of the record number of women buying guns and obtaining training resulted in an 88% decrease in rape for that area, the only city of its size in the country to experience a decrease of crime for that year. additionally, a 1979 us justice department study of 32,000 attempted rapes showed that overall, when rape is attempted, the completion rate is 36%. but when a woman defends herself with a gun, the completion rate drops to 3%. 1 g kleck, point blank: guns and violence in america aldine de gruyter, ny, 1991 2 jd wright & ph rossi armed and considered dangerous: a survey of felons and their firearms, aldine de gruyter, ny, 1986 ------- __________________________________________________________________________ [unlike cats] dogs never scratch you when you wash them. they just become very sad and try to figure out what they did wrong. -dave barry",
            "center for policy research writes... your comparison with the warsaw ghetto uprising is insulting, and racist beyond belief. the attempts to quiet any violence in the gaza strip are just that. the efforts to quell murder and mayhem in the gaza strip were the resluts of violence and came after the violence. it was not an arbitrary racial move like the nazi treatment of jews. jews had not committed acts of violence and murder as have the residents of gaza. i find your eagerness to ignore the acts of murder nothing more than anti-israel bigotry. it is not punishment, but protection from repeated attacks by residents of gaza. you self-servingly omit any references to why israel has had to take action. apparaently the deaths of innocent israeli civilians do not enter into your equation, a racist ommission on your part. the right of israel to protect its citizens from murderers is also recognized by international law. israeli civilians have been getting stabbed to death on a daily basis. if this wave of murder does not matter to you, then your posturing for the basic human rights you claim matter so much to you is nothing but an anti-israel charade. do you know of residents of gaza who have applied for israeli citizenship and were denied? i have heard of no such denials taking place. can you document this, or is this more of your stupid and innacurate propaganda? the truth is that if gazan residents applied for citizenship, hamas would murder them as collaborators. many gazans are born in towns and villages located in how dare you use such a disgusting phrase. how very easy you attack a people, when you omit facts which fly in the face of your pure racism. perhaps you are judging a people to be the racists that you are. do you believe that all jews must have the same bigoted makeup as you? here's another little fly in your ointment, about the 'master race,' for you to avoid... two months ago a plane with 86 bosnian muslims left bosnia to seek asylum in the middle east. four arab nations refused to grant them asylum. then when israli arabs agreed to take the responsibility for them, they were allowed into israel. yes, israel. but when the plane landed, the israeli arabs who had previously agreed to take care of them refused to be involved with the rescue project, because they felt that it would make israel look good. it was more important to avoid any good pr for israel than to take care of fellow muslims. israel moved them to a kibbutz, where they are safe and secure. the truth is that time after time the islamic world has turned its back on muslims in need more than israel has. even in the case of the 400 deportees, lebanon was willing to let their so-called arab brothers freeze to death rather than give them sanctuary in lebanon. nearly twice as many palestinians have been murdered by other palestinians than in confrontations with israel. hundreds of thousands of palestinians had been deported from kuwait, just because they were palestinian. the truth is that your phoney concern for the welfare of the palestinians is nothing but an excuse to attack israel. you are part of the ignorant effort to confine all concern for the welfare of the palestinians to attacking israel. but the truth is there are greater reasons than israel for the plight of the palestinians. to disregard jordan or kuwait or saudi arabia or any of the other oil-rich nations who do nothing for these people, is to use the plight of these poor people as a vehicle for your hatred of jews, or your hatred of israel. anti-semitism and anti-zionism is not the same as pro-palestinian and anyone who insists that it is the same really does not give two hoots for their welfare. your pathetic analogy is so absent of relevant fact that your racism cannot be disguised. jews had never declared war on a polish people. jews had never attacked poles with knives, or had used the ghetto as a staging ground for attacks. to take something like the warsaw ghetto(the creation of which you do not even bother to discuss!)and the uprising that followed is to degrade the dead, and to show that intelligent debate on a difficult situation is beyond your intellectual purview. you clearly have never even read a single word of the covenant of the islamic resistance movement. here is arguably the single most anti-semitic genocidal document since mein kampf, yet it is totally disregarded in your rantings. your racism is most evident in your eagerness to avoid such documentation. if it were considered, you might actually have to deal with mideast problems in a balanced manner, rather than in an anti-semitic manner. and just how was gaza obtained? do you forget that israel is not in the habit of grabbing land for the hell of it, but had taken gaza in a war that it did not start? did you know land israel captures in wars, wars which other nations have always started, aren't the same as israel, and they are subject to a completely different set of international laws? since you do continuously refer to international law, would you please say what specific international laws israel is violating? this attitude i can cite 6,000,000 reasons why it is not. where is this quote? i have never heard rabin assert that he wished such a thing. since you are in general a liar, you'll have to provide the entire quote, with source, or this effort will be regarded as just another one of your fabrications. only you are led to ask such a loaded, racist, intellectually dishonest question. you inability to come to terms with what you are has turned you into a racist of the highest order. why do you not feel the same compassion for the jews of iran, or iraq, or yemen, or saudi arabia, or syria? do you have an inkling of what they have endured over the past decades? or, what about the plight of the palestinians in kuwait? or what about the treatment of the bosnian muslims? do you think the residents of gaza are being subjected to what all the muslims in bosnia are enduring? why are you indifferent to the death and suffering of people? why do you not care that these folk are being exterminated? why do you not care that only israel has given any of these people safe haven? could it be due to the fact that it is not israel who is doing the killing? the people in gaza are not being exterminated. they aren't being killed. they aren't being raped. they aren't being starved. they aren't being driven from their lands. they are not kept from receiving food or other supplies. but the bosnians are. and the only country which has provided some sanctuary to the bosnian muslims is the same nation that you have devoted your life to attacking, in the guise of compassion. your rantings are so unfettered by the burden of intellectual honesty that you ought to take a deep breath and ask yourself what your real motives are. do not flatter yourself into the belief that truth or compassion are what drives you. in your case, it is clear that hate beats out love every time. maybe you are burdened with some kind of guilt for having been born a jew. it is obvious that your hatred of your own judaism is being dumped on all other jews. why else would you suggest a racist idea like breeding jews out of existence? maybe these fits of anti-semitism are a result of being cut off from your own people for an extended period. whatever the case may be, it is clear that you are not what you have labored so hard to appear to be. when you realize that you can't care for other people while you hate yourself you might actually begin to do some good.",

            "tony- i read your post, it was nothing new, i had seen much the same in other typical\"christian\" anti-gay sentimental literature. gay people are and will con- tinue to be persecuted as long as such propaganda petpetuates. you may be unaware of all the statistica \"findings\" concerning african-americans that have been published and used by various groups to re-enforce their own bias against african-americans. we usually think of the kkk in these instances, but there are many other groups. of course, the vast majority of the public scoff at such findings and documents today, but that was not always the case. fortunately african-americans had \"whites\" who supported their 'cause' and public sentiment was eventually (if not entirely) turned around. there was even a civil war, and anti-negro sentiment increased. in fact, until laws were put in place to protect the inalienable rights of blacks it was pretty much legal to discriminate against them. i know many gays and i will not turn my back on them or their right to be free form discrimination. you may think that i have been deceived or something, that is your perogative. my church, christian church (disciples of christ) openly affirms the rights of oppressed people of all segments of society, including gays. we believe the gospel message of preaching to all creation and making disciples. we believe in the lord's great commandment to love, and we beleive in standing up for the oppressed, even if it is not popular to do so. i really like my church for last reason the most. i can find a church almost anywhere in the valley that stands for the gospel and believes in the commandment of love (though i'm hard-pressed to find many who actually sho love), but not many are willing to champion the oppressed, especially within their own community. i may have lost face with the greater christian community for the unpopularity of my beliefs, but so did the abolitionists against the oppression of african-americans. many were even killed and treated as runaway slaves for being \"nigger-lovers\" and such. i guess i've decided the challenge is worth it. in my talks with gay men and women i have heard tragic story after tragic story centering around failed marriages, wives and husbands who are straight who have been hurt in the process, etc. funny thing is, i don't know of one case where the parents, ex-wives, or even children have continued to reject their gay family member (son, daughter, ex-husband, father, etc.) after they began to take part in some form of support group, like pflag. i'm apalled by the legislation which passed in colorado, and am equally out0 raged that such slimey people as louis sheldon (from the tradition values coalition) have been actively working in the christian underground to garner support within several (8 i believe) states this coming november for more oppressive legisation against gays. perhaps you don't get it, and maybe you never will. many didn't get it in the middle ages and the proclaimed god's will be done as they massacred thousands in witch hunts and inquisitions. the message that comes through, loud and clear, by proponents against gay rights and against gays in general, is that there is a strong dislike, even hatred for gays, whether you want to call it such or not (it doesn't change the results). the major flaw in all this posturing is that in the end, the final effect of posts like that of yours and mr. hudson is that you have a \"conditional\" love for gays. condition: change and we'll love you. this is sure strange coming from a group who claim that god has an \"unconditional\" love, one that calls people \"just as they are.\" sure there are things that will 'naturally' change, and habits (like alcoholism, wife beating, etc.) that need to be changed through some sort of therapy. but then there are things like left-handedness, etc. that no amount of beating it out of people, is going to result in anything more than an outward conforminty to \"other people's expectations.\" in the process this coerced conformity causes many people a great deal of harm, especially when it is caused by people who have nothing more to gain from it that to become even more puffed up about their own sense of pseuper-spirituality. this is sad, but i thoroughly believe that one day it will change. it may be unpopular to cry for justice and equality when the basis has to do with something very personal like 'sexuality' (a taboo subject even today), but i firmly believe in the rights of individuals to be free from impose regulation on thier bedrooms. it's funny that most straight people have successfully removed restrictive and oppressive legislation against invasive legislation, but we like to maintain this little chestnut of repression...as though it helps us maintain a sense of superiority over at least one segment of society. gay people are not criminals. another interesting thing happened recently. a very prominent charismatic church in the silicon valley (here) had two of it's pastors arrested for self- admitted charges of pederasty (men having sex with boys). this had apparently been going on for some time (a couple years?), but since the charges were voluntary, and the church worked closely with the police, so i imagine that was how they managed to downplay it in the media. how could such a thing happen when the church, itself, has an ex-gay ministry? one of my friends recently told me he was \"approached\" by someone who is going through the reparitive therapy there, and he was thoroughly convinced that the request for dinner was not an invitation to attend the ministry. these are difficult times we live in, but providing hostile environments and creating and perpetuating an atmosphere that breed hate and violence is not the call of the christian community. the results of the passing amendment in colorado has created an organization who's posters are appearing all over colorado called \"s.t.r.a.i.g.h.t.\" (i forget the whole definition off hand, but the last part was against immoral gross homosexual trash) and their motto is \"working for a fag-free america\" with an implicit advocation for violence. this is sick, and it seems to be what you and mr. hudson, and others are embracing. we christians have a loooooooooong tradition of coersion and oppression towards those we feel don't 'measure up', and constant beratement from organizations like the christian research institute, while they do have a good purpose also, their major work seems to be finding new and better ways of excluding people. the gospel i believe is not so negative, rather it seeks ways to \"include\" people. i have several of dr. martin's books and find them quite helpful, especially concerning 'cults.' but it seems that cri, has become a cult unto itself. why don't we just stick to the positive and find ways to bring people to jesus istead of taking bullwhips and driving them away? whatever",

            "in <apr.10.05.30.16.1993.14313@athos.rutgers.edu> [ . . . ] having lived through the kicking and screaming in the 60s and 70s as the catholics were invited to participate in the liturgy instead of counting their rosary beads during mass, i find this comment interesting. there is a _massively_ longer tradition for proclaiming the passion accounts without active participation. if you know the latin, one really beautiful way to hear the passion is it's being chanted by three deacons: the narrator chants in the middle baritone range, jesus chants in the bass, and others directly quoted are handled by a high tenor. this is actually the basis for the common proclamation of the passion that john would prefer. but there is always a judgement call based on pastoral considerations. each pastor makes his own decisions (it isn't a church-wide conspiracy against participation). the palm sunday liturgy, with its initial blessing and distribution of the palms and procession, is already getting long before you get to the passion; some pastors feel that they should not make the people stand through that long narrative. also, the orchestrated proclamation with multiple readers and public participation in the crowd quotations runs longer than the single-reader proclamation --- in churches with multiple masses for the sunday, it might be necessary to go with the briefer options just to \"get 'em in and get 'em out\". each parish is different. catholics are no longer canonically tied to their geographic parishes. it is possible that another catholic parish in the columbus area (based on the ohio state address) has a liturgy closer to your preferences. or talk to some of your fellow parishioners and see how common your preferences are --- pastors generally are willing to listen to non-confrontational requests. though you probably should bring along a paramedic in case he reacts too strongly to the shock of people asked for a _longer_ sunday mass. perhaps the problem is that recent liturgical development hasn't follow the continuous evolution model (the accumulation of small changes, no single one of which is too hard to take) but rather the punctuated equilibrium model (things stay the same and we get accustomed to them, then the marked mutation hits). {my apologies if i am mis-remembering the names of the evolutionary theories.}",

            "there are a couple of ways to look at them. one is, \"we want you to support this constitution, so we'll say anything that we think will appeal to you,\" or the more straightforward, \"this is why we think what we've suggested in this constitution is a good idea.\" you clearly consider the former to be the primary situation. well, i know hamilton was a dyed in the wool monarchist, and probably the authoritarian extreme to jefferson's democratic impules. but what would you suggest as a means of determining their opinions on the government if we don't consider what they wrote about the government? and is writing in support of something automatically \"propoganda\" to the point we must assume it is untrue or that they are saying what they don't believe? if the senate was less powerful than the house of lords, than we'd almost have to state that the house of representatives was also. (in fact, they both were, because the british government had much greater power than did the american system). i disagree. the system is not too slow, it was simply designed to handle less than it has demanded that it handle. as somebody in washington put it (whose name i forget), \"congress has become everybody's city council.\" congress is more than capable of quick action, and has more than enough power and time on its hands, if it confined itself to what its original jurisidiction was and allowed more local autonomy. it is not a case of the system of government they created failing, but that it is operating under a set of conditions they specifically wanted to avoid. namely, a concentration of power. it would seem then that the proper thing to do is not to reduce the power of either house in some attempt to grease the wheels. all you'll get then is a system which moves quicker to do stupid things. it would make more sense to make more decisions at a local level. please explain to me how bush abused the veto in an \"extraordinary\" manner. i fail to see where any restrictions, implied or otherwise, were placed on the veto. it could just as easily have been read as a means to put a check on democratically popular but unwise (in the executive's opinion) policies. there is no limit in the constitution to the president's veto power regarding what a bill is for. previous presidents have used the veto for any number of reasons, most usually having something to do with their agenda. i am really curious how you single bush out as *the* president who abused vetos. why is it not a reasonable restriction? because 51 senators is the magic holy number upon which laws must be based? if 41 senators feel safe enough with their state constituencies to stand up and fillibuster isn't that *enough* to indicate there's a sufficient question as to whether a law is a good idea or not to re-evaluate it? why one earth *should* 51% be sufficient to enact a law which covers 250 million people in very, very diverse places and living in radically different conditions? why *shouldn't* a super-majority be required? any system in which the simple majority is given absolute power to ignore the minority then the minority *will* be ignored. i do not see this as a positive thing. and for all that i'm sure the republicans are looking for pork as much as the democrats, they've got some legitimate objections to the legislation in question.",

            "if we had backed him strongly early on i doubt there would be the problem there is now. many russians became disillusioned with democracy and reforms when they felt, rightly imo, that the west didn't care. yeltsin was virtually promised massive aid (once bush got over his gorby-mania.) this probably kept him from dismantling the congress and calling for new elections. well, the aid didn't come through and we didn't make sure it went to the proper places and now the anti-reformers are gaining strength where before they were in hiding. if they don't reform i don't believe in giving them money. however, i think this is too important to take a non-interventionist approach. this is what really bugs me about libertarianism -- it sounds like 'it'll all be the same in a hundred years time. no need to do anything.' despite the wishes of libertarians, this society is a far way, and getting farther, from being libertarian. perhaps voluntary gifts would work if we had the proper framework but we do not have it. we have to face the problem *now*, not in x years when we have a libertarian dream society. right now there are huge stumbling blocks to trade, let alone charity. there are still limitations to high-tech exports. nasa can't buy proton launch vehicles from them. sure, the market may be able to help a great deal but it can't right now. there are too many obstacles. instead of fighting against the aid you should be fighting to tear down the obstacles the market and charities have to face. well, i think limited government is primarily democratic due to it being limited. but the main question is how do you transform a state-run economy and monolithic government into something that even remotely looks like ours? (btw, sometimes it seems that our government is trying to go the opposite direction) it is not going to be painless and not going to be easy. we simply cannot wait to help when they *have* the 'proper' government. they'll never get there without the aid. it may be too late already. and i'm just excercising mine. as i also said above, another problem i have is with *transformation*. a libertarian society is not going to happen painlessly or overnight. i have seen nothing about how to take our current government and society and turn it into a minimal government and a responsible self-sufficient populace. they didn't have nuclear weapons 100 years ago. nor instantaneous communications nor travel to virtually anyplace on the earth in less than a day. yes, depend on the rulers of the free market and the businesses. rulers do emerge *somewhere* and they will never represent the opinions of every person on the planet. there must be checks and balances. checks on the government when it gets out of bounds and checks on industry when it gets out of bounds. putting all your hopes on the benevolence of the market is, to me, just like putting all your hopes on the benevolence of government.",

            "but good ones can collapse somewhat, then come back the next year. burleigh grimes went from 20+ wins and an era of 3 or so in '24 to 13-19 and an era around 4 in '25. he pitched well for several more years. carlton won 13 and lost 20 the year after his 27-10 record. (source: bill james historical baseball abstract.) and let's not forget john tudor, who started 1-5 and finished 21-6 in 1985. he had a pretty bad era when you take busch stadium into account at the start of the season. if i recall, he had a 4.50 era in the 1st half and a 3.50 era in the 2nd half of last year. hmmm, 21 runs in 11 innings. suppose he starts 30 more games, and winds up w/200 innings pitched. if he allows 4 runs a game in the next 189 innings, he'll have a 4.75 era or so at the end of the year. (i think i have his totals right.) this is going to be hard to come back from. my 1st hunch is that morris is very gutsy, and that he may be pitching through an injury and not telling anyone. my 2nd guess is that he will be banished to the bullpen the remainder of the season after a few more starts. (perhaps when stewart comes off the dl? or will danny cox, who went 3 or 4 scoreless innings against the tribe today, start for morris? he looks like a really good one. gaston is scrambling to find starters, i'd imagine. luckily, the jays have a very good offense.) i don't think they would dare release him before the end of the year. he'll just be replaced by stewart or cox.",

            "-----begin pgp signed message----- please note that the following speech was made by chuck hammill in 1987. address all letters to his address, given at the end of this document. -- russell from crossbows to cryptography: thwarting the state via technology given at the future of freedom conference, november 1987 you know, technology--and particularly computer technology--has often gotten a bad rap in libertarian cir- cles. we tend to think of orwell's 1984, or terry gilliam's brazil, or the proximity detectors keeping east berlin's slave/citizens on their own side of the border, or the so- phisticated bugging devices nixon used to harass those on his \"enemies list.\" or, we recognize that for the price of a ticket on the concorde we can fly at twice the speed of sound, but only if we first walk thru a magnetometer run by a government policeman, and permit him to paw thru our be- longings if it beeps. but i think that mind-set is a mistake. before there were cattle prods, governments tortured their prisoners with clubs and rubber hoses. before there were lasers for eavesdropping, governments used binoculars and lip-readers. though government certainly uses technology to oppress, the evil lies not in the tools but in the wielder of the tools. in fact, technology represents one of the most promis- ing avenues available for re-capturing our freedoms from those who have stolen them. by its very nature, it favors the bright (who can put it to use) over the dull (who can- not). it favors the adaptable (who are quick to see the merit of the new (over the sluggish (who cling to time- tested ways). and what two better words are there to de- scribe government bureaucracy than \"dull\" and \"sluggish\"? one of the clearest, classic triumphs of technology over tyranny i see is the invention of the man-portable crossbow. with it, an untrained peasant could now reliably and lethally engage a target out to fifty meters--even if that target were a mounted, chain-mailed knight. (unlike the longbow, which, admittedly was more powerful, and could get off more shots per unit time, the crossbow required no formal training to utilize. whereas the longbow required elaborate visual, tactile and kinesthetic coordination to achieve any degree of accuracy, the wielder of a crossbow could simply put the weapon to his shoulder, sight along the arrow itself, and be reasonably assured of hitting his tar- get.) moreover, since just about the only mounted knights likely to visit your average peasant would be government soldiers and tax collectors, the utility of the device was plain: with it, the common rabble could defend themselves not only against one another, but against their governmental masters. it was the medieval equivalent of the armor- piercing bullet, and, consequently, kings and priests (the medieval equivalent of a bureau of alcohol, tobacco and crossbows) threatened death and excommunication, respec- tively, for its unlawful possession. looking at later developments, we see how technology like the firearm--particularly the repeating rifle and the handgun, later followed by the gatling gun and more advanced machine guns--radically altered the balance of interpersonal and inter-group power. not without reason was the colt .45 called \"the equalizer.\" a frail dance-hall hostess with one in her possession was now fully able to protect herself against the brawniest roughneck in any saloon. advertise- ments for the period also reflect the merchandising of the repeating cartridge rifle by declaring that \"a man on horseback, armed with one of these rifles, simply cannot be captured.\" and, as long as his captors were relying upon flintlocks or single-shot rifles, the quote is doubtless a true one. updating now to the present, the public-key cipher (with a personal computer to run it) represents an equiv- alent quantum leap--in a defensive weapon. not only can such a technique be used to protect sensitive data in one's own possession, but it can also permit two strangers to ex- change information over an insecure communications channel--a wiretapped phone line, for example, or skywriting, for that matter)--without ever having previously met to exchange cipher keys. with a thousand-dollar com- puter, you can create a cipher that a multi-megabuck cray x-mp can't crack in a year. within a few years, it should be economically feasible to similarly encrypt voice communi- cations; soon after that, full-color digitized video images. technology will not only have made wiretapping obsolete, it will have totally demolished government's control over in- formation transfer. i'd like to take just a moment to sketch the mathemat- ics which makes this principle possible. this algorithm is called the rsa algorithm, after rivest, shamir, and adleman who jointly created it. its security derives from the fact that, if a very large number is the product of two very large primes, then it is extremely difficult to obtain the two prime factors from analysis of their product. \"ex- tremely\" in the sense that if primes p and q have 100 digits apiece, then their 200-digit product cannot in gen- eral be factored in less than 100 years by the most powerful computer now in existence. the \"public\" part of the key consists of (1) the prod- uct pq of the two large primes p and q, and (2) one fac- tor, call it x , of the product xy where xy = {(p-1) * (q-1) + 1}. the \"private\" part of the key consists of the other factor y. each block of the text to be encrypted is first turned into an integer--either by using ascii, or even a simple a=01, b=02, c=03, ... , z=26 representation. this integer is then raised to the power x (modulo pq) and the resulting integer is then sent as the encrypted message. the receiver decrypts by taking this integer to the (secret) power y (modulo pq). it can be shown that this process will always yield the original number started with. what makes this a groundbreaking development, and why it is called \"public-key\" cryptography,\" is that i can openly publish the product pq and the number x , while keeping secret the number y --so that anyone can send me an encrypted message, namely x a (mod pq) , but only i can recover the original message a , by taking what they send, raising it to the power y and taking the result (mod pq). the risky step (meeting to exchange cipher keys) has been eliminated. so people who may not even trust each other enough to want to meet, may still reliably ex- change encrypted messages--each party having selected and disseminated his own pq and his x , while maintaining the secrecy of his own y. another benefit of this scheme is the notion of a \"dig- ital signature,\" to enable one to authenticate the source of a given message. normally, if i want to send you a message, i raise my plaintext a to your x and take the result (mod your pq) and send that. however, if in my message, i take the plaintext a and raise it to my (secret) power y , take the result (mod my pq), then raise that result to your x (mod your pq) and send this, then even after you have normally \"decrypted\" the message, it will still look like garbage. however, if you then raise it to my public power x , and take the result (mod my public pq ), so you will not only recover the ori- ginal plaintext message, but you will know that no one but i could have sent it to you (since no one else knows my secret y). and these are the very concerns by the way that are to- day tormenting the soviet union about the whole question of personal computers. on the one hand, they recognize that american schoolchildren are right now growing up with com- puters as commonplace as sliderules used to be--more so, in fact, because there are things computers can do which will interest (and instruct) 3- and 4-year-olds. and it is pre- cisely these students who one generation hence will be going head-to-head against their soviet counterparts. for the soviets to hold back might be a suicidal as continuing to teach swordsmanship while your adversaries are learning ballistics. on the other hand, whatever else a personal computer may be, it is also an exquisitely efficient copying machine--a floppy disk will hold upwards of 50,000 words of text, and can be copied in a couple of minutes. if this weren't threatening enough, the computer that performs the copy can also encrypt the data in a fashion that is all but unbreakable. remember that in soviet society publicly ac- cessible xerox machines are unknown. (the relatively few copying machines in existence are controlled more inten- sively than machine guns are in the united states.) now the \"conservative\" position is that we should not sell these computers to the soviets, because they could use them in weapons systems. the \"liberal\" position is that we should sell them, in the interests of mutual trade and cooperation--and anyway, if we don't make the sale, there will certainly be some other nation willing to. for my part, i'm ready to suggest that the libertarian position should be to give them to the soviets for free, and if necessary, make them take them . . . and if that doesn't work load up an sr-71 blackbird and air drop them over moscow in the middle of the night. paid for by private sub- scription, of course, not taxation . . . i confess that this is not a position that has gained much support among members of the conventional left-right political spectrum, but, af- ter all, in the words of one of illuminatus's characters, we are political non-euclideans: the shortest distance to a particular goal may not look anything like what most people would consider a \"straight line.\" taking a long enough world-view, it is arguable that breaking the soviet govern- ment monopoly on information transfer could better lead to the enfeeblement and, indeed, to the ultimate dissolution of the soviet empire than would the production of another dozen missiles aimed at moscow. but there's the rub: a \"long enough\" world view does suggest that the evil, the oppressive, the coercive and the simply stupid will \"get what they deserve,\" but what's not immediately clear is how the rest of us can escape being killed, enslaved, or pauperized in the process. when the liberals and other collectivists began to at- tack freedom, they possessed a reasonably stable, healthy, functioning economy, and almost unlimited time to proceed to hamstring and dismantle it. a policy of political gradualism was at least conceivable. but now, we have patchwork crazy-quilt economy held together by baling wire and spit. the state not only taxes us to \"feed the poor\" while also inducing farmers to slaughter milk cows and drive up food prices--it then simultaneously turns around and sub- sidizes research into agricultural chemicals designed to in- crease yields of milk from the cows left alive. or witness the fact that a decline in the price of oil is considered as potentially frightening as a comparable increase a few years ago. when the price went up, we were told, the economy risked collapse for for want of energy. the price increase was called the \"moral equivalent of war\" and the feds swung into action. for the first time in american history, the speed at which you drive your car to work in the morning be- came an issue of federal concern. now, when the price of oil drops, again we risk problems, this time because ameri- can oil companies and third world basket-case nations who sell oil may not be able to ever pay their debts to our grossly over-extended banks. the suggested panacea is that government should now re-raise the oil prices that opec has lowered, via a new oil tax. since the government is seeking to raise oil prices to about the same extent as opec did, what can we call this except the \"moral equivalent of civil war--the government against its own people?\" and, classically, in international trade, can you imag- ine any entity in the world except a government going to court claiming that a vendor was selling it goods too cheaply and demanding not only that that naughty vendor be compelled by the court to raise its prices, but also that it be punished for the act of lowering them in the first place? so while the statists could afford to take a couple of hundred years to trash our economy and our liberties--we certainly cannot count on having an equivalent period of stability in which to reclaim them. i contend that there exists almost a \"black hole\" effect in the evolution of nation-states just as in the evolution of stars. once free- dom contracts beyond a certain minimum extent, the state warps the fabric of the political continuum about itself to the degree that subsequent re-emergence of freedom becomes all but impossible. a good illustration of this can be seen in the area of so-called \"welfare\" payments. when those who sup at the public trough outnumber (and thus outvote) those whose taxes must replenish the trough, then what possible choice has a democracy but to perpetuate and expand the tak- ing from the few for the unearned benefit of the many? go down to the nearest \"welfare\" office, find just two people on the dole . . . and recognize that between them they form a voting bloc that can forever outvote you on the question of who owns your life--and the fruits of your life's labor. so essentially those who love liberty need an \"edge\" of some sort if we're ultimately going to prevail. we obvi- ously can't use the altruists' \"other-directedness\" of \"work, slave, suffer, sacrifice, so that next generation of a billion random strangers can live in a better world.\" recognize that, however immoral such an appeal might be, it is nonetheless an extremely powerful one in today's culture. if you can convince people to work energetically for a \"cause,\" caring only enough for their personal welfare so as to remain alive enough and healthy enough to continue working--then you have a truly massive reservoir of energy to draw from. equally clearly, this is just the sort of ap- peal which tautologically cannot be utilized for egoistic or libertarian goals. if i were to stand up before you tonight and say something like, \"listen, follow me as i enunciate my noble \"cause,\" contribute your money to support the \"cause,\" give up your free time to work for the \"cause,\" strive selflessly to bring it about, and then (after you and your children are dead) maybe your children's children will actu- ally live under egoism\"--you'd all think i'd gone mad. and of course you'd be right. because the point i'm trying to make is that libertarianism and/or egoism will be spread if, when, and as, individual libertarians and/or egoists find it profitable and/or enjoyable to do so. and probably only then. while i certainly do not disparage the concept of poli- tical action, i don't believe that it is the only, nor even necessarily the most cost-effective path toward increasing freedom in our time. consider that, for a fraction of the investment in time, money and effort i might expend in try- ing to convince the state to abolish wiretapping and all forms of censorship--i can teach every libertarian who's in- terested how to use cryptography to abolish them unilaterally. there is a maxim--a proverb--generally attributed to the eskimoes, which very likely most libertarians have al- ready heard. and while you likely would not quarrel with the saying, you might well feel that you've heard it often enough already, and that it has nothing further to teach us, and moreover, that maybe you're even tired of hearing it. i shall therefore repeat it now: if you give a man a fish, the saying runs, you feed him for a day. but if you teach a man how to fish, you feed him for a lifetime. your exposure to the quote was probably in some sort of a \"workfare\" vs. \"welfare\" context; namely, that if you genuinely wish to help someone in need, you should teach him how to earn his sustenance, not simply how to beg for it. and of course this is true, if only because the next time he is hungry, there might not be anybody around willing or even able to give him a fish, whereas with the information on how to fish, he is completely self sufficient. but i submit that this exhausts only the first order content of the quote, and if there were nothing further to glean from it, i would have wasted your time by citing it again. after all, it seems to have almost a crypto-altruist slant, as though to imply that we should structure our ac- tivities so as to maximize the benefits to such hungry beggars as we may encounter. but consider: suppose this eskimo doesn't know how to fish, but he does know how to hunt walruses. you, on the other hand, have often gone hungry while traveling thru walrus country because you had no idea how to catch the damn things, and they ate most of the fish you could catch. and now suppose the two of you decide to exchange information, bartering fishing knowledge for hunting knowledge. well, the first thing to observe is that a transaction of this type categorically and unambiguously refutes the marxist premise that every trade must have a \"winner\" and a \"loser;\" the idea that if one person gains, it must necessarily be at the \"expense\" of another person who loses. clearly, under this scenario, such is not the case. each party has gained some- thing he did not have before, and neither has been dimin- ished in any way. when it comes to exchange of information (rather than material objects) life is no longer a zero-sum game. this is an extremely powerful notion. the \"law of diminishing returns,\" the \"first and second laws of thermodynamics\"--all those \"laws\" which constrain our possi- bilities in other contexts--no longer bind us! now that's anarchy! or consider another possibility: suppose this hungry eskimo never learned to fish because the ruler of his nation-state had decreed fishing illegal. because fish contain dangerous tiny bones, and sometimes sharp spines, he tells us, the state has decreed that their consumption--and even their possession--are too hazardous to the people's health to be permitted . . . even by knowledgeable, willing adults. perhaps it is because citizens' bodies are thought to be government property, and therefore it is the function of the state to punish those who improperly care for govern- ment property. or perhaps it is because the state gener- ously extends to competent adults the \"benefits\" it provides to children and to the mentally ill: namely, a full-time, all-pervasive supervisory conservatorship--so that they need not trouble themselves with making choices about behavior thought physically risky or morally \"naughty.\" but, in any case, you stare stupefied, while your eskimo informant re- lates how this law is taken so seriously that a friend of his was recently imprisoned for years for the crime of \"pos- session of nine ounces of trout with intent to distribute.\" now you may conclude that a society so grotesquely oppressive as to enforce a law of this type is simply an affront to the dignity of all human beings. you may go far- ther and decide to commit some portion of your discretion- ary, recreational time specifically to the task of thwarting this tyrant's goal. (your rationale may be \"altruistic\" in the sense of wanting to liberate the oppressed, or \"egoistic\" in the sense of proving you can outsmart the oppressor--or very likely some combination of these or per- haps even other motives.) but, since you have zero desire to become a martyr to your \"cause,\" you're not about to mount a military campaign, or even try to run a boatload of fish through the blockade. however, it is here that technology--and in particular in- formation technology--can multiply your efficacy literally a hundredfold. i say \"literally,\" because for a fraction of the effort (and virtually none of the risk) attendant to smuggling in a hundred fish, you can quite readily produce a hundred xerox copies of fishing instructions. (if the tar- geted government, like present-day america, at least permits open discussion of topics whose implementation is re- stricted, then that should suffice. but, if the government attempts to suppress the flow of information as well, then you will have to take a little more effort and perhaps write your fishing manual on a floppy disk encrypted according to your mythical eskimo's public-key parameters. but as far as increasing real-world access to fish you have made genuine nonzero headway--which may continue to snowball as others re-disseminate the information you have provided. and you have not had to waste any of your time trying to convert id- eological adversaries, or even trying to win over the unde- cided. recall harry browne's dictum from \"freedom in an unfree world\" that the success of any endeavor is in general inversely proportional to the number of people whose persua- sion is necessary to its fulfilment. if you look at history, you cannot deny that it has been dramatically shaped by men with names like washington, lincoln, . . . nixon . . . marcos . . . duvalier . . . khadaffi . . . and their ilk. but it has also been shaped by people with names like edison, curie, marconi, tesla and wozniak. and this latter shaping has been at least as per- vasive, and not nearly so bloody. and that's where i'm trying to take the libertech project. rather than beseeching the state to please not en- slave, plunder or constrain us, i propose a libertarian net- work spreading the technologies by which we may seize freedom for ourselves. but here we must be a bit careful. while it is not (at present) illegal to encrypt information when government wants to spy on you, there is no guarantee of what the fu- ture may hold. there have been bills introduced, for exam- ple, which would have made it a crime to wear body armor when government wants to shoot you. that is, if you were to commit certain crimes while wearing a kevlar vest, then that fact would constitute a separate federal crime of its own. this law to my knowledge has not passed . . . yet . . . but it does indicate how government thinks. other technological applications, however, do indeed pose legal risks. we recognize, for example, that anyone who helped a pre-civil war slave escape on the \"underground railroad\" was making a clearly illegal use of technology--as the sovereign government of the united states of america at that time found the buying and selling of human beings quite as acceptable as the buying and selling of cattle. simi- larly, during prohibition, anyone who used his bathtub to ferment yeast and sugar into the illegal psychoactive drug, alcohol--the controlled substance, wine--was using technol- ogy in a way that could get him shot dead by federal agents for his \"crime\"--unfortunately not to be restored to life when congress reversed itself and re-permitted use of this drug. so . . . to quote a former president, un-indicted co- conspirator and pardoned felon . . . \"let me make one thing perfectly clear:\" the libertech project does not advocate, participate in, or conspire in the violation of any law--no matter how oppressive, unconstitutional or simply stupid such law may be. it does engage in description (for educa- tional and informational purposes only) of technological processes, and some of these processes (like flying a plane or manufacturing a firearm) may well require appropriate li- censing to perform legally. fortunately, no license is needed for the distribution or receipt of information it- self. so, the next time you look at the political scene and despair, thinking, \"well, if 51% of the nation and 51% of this state, and 51% of this city have to turn libertarian before i'll be free, then somebody might as well cut my goddamn throat now, and put me out of my misery\"--recognize that such is not the case. there exist ways to make your- self free. if you wish to explore such techniques via the project, you are welcome to give me your name and address--or a fake name and mail drop, for that matter--and you'll go on the mailing list for my erratically-published newsletter. any friends or acquaintances whom you think would be interested are welcome as well. i'm not even asking for stamped self- addressed envelopes, since my printer can handle mailing la- bels and actual postage costs are down in the noise compared with the other efforts in getting an issue out. if you should have an idea to share, or even a useful product to plug, i'll be glad to have you write it up for publication. even if you want to be the proverbial \"free rider\" and just benefit from what others contribute--you're still welcome: everything will be public domain; feel free to copy it or give it away (or sell it, for that matter, 'cause if you can get money for it while i'm taking full-page ads trying to give it away, you're certainly entitled to your capitalist profit . . .) anyway, every application of these principles should make the world just a little freer, and i'm certainly willing to underwrite that, at least for the forseeable fu- ture. i will leave you with one final thought: if you don't learn how to beat your plowshares into swords before they outlaw swords, then you sure as hell ought to learn before they outlaw plowshares too. --chuck hammill the libertech project 3194 queensbury drive los angeles, california 90064 310-836-4157 hammill@netcom.com [the above libertech address was updated december 1992, with the permission of chuck hammill, by russell whitaker] those interested in the issues raised in this piece should participate in at least these newsgroups: alt.privacy alt.security.pgp comp.org.eff.talk sci.crypt a copy of the rsa-based public key encryption program, pgp 2.1 (pretty good privacy), can be obtained at various ftp sites around the world. one such site is gate.demon.co.uk, where an ms-dos version can be had by anonymous ftp as pgp22.zip in /pub/pgp. versions for other operating systems, including unix variants and macintosh, are also available. source code is also available. here's the blurb for pgp, by the way: - ---------------------- quote ---------------------------------------- pgp (pretty good privacy) ver 2.2 - rsa public-key encryption freeware for msdos, protects e-mail. lets you communicate securely with people you've never met, with no secure channels needed for prior exchange of keys. well featured and fast! excellent user documentation. pgp has sophisticated key management, an rsa/conventional hybrid encryption scheme, message digests for digital signatures, data compression before encryption, and good ergonomic design. source code is free. filenames: pgp22.zip (executable and manuals), pgp22src.zip (sources) keywords: pgp, pretty good privacy, rsa, public key, encryption, privacy, authentication, signatures, email - ---------------------- end quote ------------------------------------- russell earl whitaker whitaker@eternity.demon.co.uk communications editor amix: rwhitaker extropy: the journal of transhumanist thought board member, extropy institute (exi) -----begin pgp signature----- version: 2.2",

(a copy of this agreement can be found in the 'congressional record,' november 1, 1945; see document 1.) on this side of the atlantic, nazi armenians were aware of their brethrens alliance. they had often expressed pro-nazi sentiments until america entered the war. in 1941, while the jews were being assembled for their doom in the nazi concentration camps, the nazi armenians in germany formed the first armenian battalion to fight alongside the nazis. in 1943, this battalion had grown into eight battalions of 30,000-strong under the command of dro (the butcher), who was the former dictator of x-soviet armenia and the architect of the cold-blooded genocide of 2.5 million turks and kurds between 1914-1920. an armenian national council was formed by the notorious dashnak party leaders in berlin, which was recognized by the nazis. encouraged by this, the armenians summarily formed a provisional government that endorsed and espoused fully the principles of the nazis and declared themselves as the members of the aryan super race and full participants to hitler's policy of extermination of the jews. this armenian-nazi conspiracy against the jews during wwii was an \"encore\" performance staged by the armenians during wwi, when they back-stabbed and exterminated 2.5 million muslims by colluding with the invading russian army. serdar argic",

(my pessimism is due to more conservative assumptions on market capture and growth in leo communications and satellite direct broadcasting services. i don't believe all of the current players in the yet-to-be-born leo communications satellite market and in the yet-to-be-proven direct broadcasting market will be financial successes, nor that sales growth will be as explosive as currently projected.) it should also be noted this year's doc data is the first release to show revenues from privately funded microgravity research facilities. the $60 m shown in the janurary data is primarily for the spacehab module, planned for launch in april on the space shuttle, but also hidden in these numbers are the projected first sales from the comet orbital launch and recovery experiment module.] 2- delta wins two key launch contracts mcdonnell douglas corporation, which builds and markets the delta launch vehicle has won two important launch contracts. motorola inc. announced in mid february that it had selected the delta to launch most of the satellites in the 66-satellite iridium leo communications constellation, and in mid april, mcdonnell douglas was awarded the usaf medium launch vehicle iii contract. the launch services contract with motorola for the iridium constellation launch is for at launch of least 45 iridium satellites. another 21 satellites have been contracted to be launched by khrunichev enterprise in russian on 3 proton vehicle launches. these 45 satellites planned for the delta will be launched 5 at a time, providing for at least 9 launches. additional satellites in the iridium constellation, such as a planned on-orbit spares, may also be launched on delta. although details of the launch services contract were reported to be negotiation, and not yet final. the usaf mlv contract also went to mdc, bidding a variant of their delta ii launcher. this contract is only initially worth $7.5 million, but establishes a set of launch options for up to 36 launches, encompassing launches from 1996 through 2002. these launches will deploy the next generation of the usaf's global positioning system block iir navigation satellites, plus other programs. first option for to meet the usaf launch options is expected to be exercised this year, after which the usaf is expected to request launches of up to 6 deltas per year for at least 6 years. under this contract the usaf can also request \"launch on demand\" services from mdc for the 1996-2002 time period, with a launch to occur within 40 days of the request. [commentary: if these two contracts are fulfilled, they should provide an excellent business base for mdc's delta launch program through the turn of the century. combined, these two contracts have a potential for about 45 launches, worth about $2,200 m to mdc, and sustaining a core business base of $300-400 m/year. other contracts for international and commercial payloads, as well as for nasa medium elv-class payloads, will add to this business base -- keeping mdc as a viable commerical launch company. however, it should be noted there are risk elements in these contracts. motorola's iridium leo communications constellation has not yet received a us federal communications commission license for operation in the u.s., nor has motorola lined up all the financing and financial partners for the iridium venture. without these approvals or financial backing there will be no iridium launches. but, hopefully, these uncertainties will be settled this year. similarly, the usaf mlv iii program has been the target of several congressional actions which have slowed the production of the gps block iir satellites and deleted the funding for the mlv iii program in favor of the usaf nls/\"spacelifter\" program. at this time, while it appears the mlv iii contract will be executed, future funding for the mlv iii and other usaf commercial launch contracts is being reconsidered as part of national space launch strategy reviews. some opinions expressed from within the administration and congress propose cancellation of all \"elv upgrade\" programs (including the mlv programs) in favor of the proposed \"spacelifter\" program. such opinions may have some weight in this year's budget deliberations, particularly as dod funds will be more difficult to find in the shrinking us defense budget.] 3- commercial remote sensing venture gets doc \"go-ahead\" the first commercial license to operate a remote sensing satellite was approved in early february by the us department of commerce's office of space commerce. a license was granted to worldview imaging corporation of oakland, california to build and operate a pair of leo imaging satellites to provide multi-spectral images of the earth. [commentary: there has been little data released on this venture by worldview and the doc, other than the announcement of the operating and construction license. this was reported to be at the request of worldview. most industry speculation identifies this new venture as a \"star wars\" spinoff, using sdi-type technology to provide digital earth sensing data, and heavily integrated into digital gis databases for remote sensing/gis users. most probable customers for this service include exploration geologists, agricultural planners, and urban planners. it is noteworthy this is the first commercial venture under the 1992 land remote sensing policy act. the act, as passed last november, provides that remote sensing data gathered from private remote sensing craft may be sold to users at differing prices. prior to this act, remote sensing data from all satellites had to be sold to all users at the same prices, and private remote sensing ventures would have had to sell at the government-set landsat data prices. there are rumors of several other potential commercial remote sensing ventures working their way through the system at different stages of development. i think the large landsat and spot satellite systems will provide the majority of the satellite remote sensing data market for the next decade or so. in contrast to these large, government-sponsored remote sensing systems, smaller market ventures such as worldview and others can exploit market niches and use innovative technology, and i believe, can find profitability on the margin. i predict there may be some very interesting ventures appearing in the next year or so.] 4- investment firm calls gd's space biz \"still a good investment\" wall street investment house morgan stanley thinks general dynamic's space systems division could still be a moneymaker, despite having failed in the last 3 atlas launches. in a recent analyst's report morgan stanley said \"we are more than ever convinced that if the company can return the atlas to its historical 95%-plus success rate, this will become a highly profitable, cash- generating unit.\" based upon discussions with gd's corporate management, morgan stanley projects that if the atlas problems are cleared up the unit could see $70 m in earnings per year by 1995 and $100 m per year by 2000. this is based upon gd's projection of capturing about 10 atlas launches per year on the world market. [commentary: three failures in a row of their launch system has hurt general dynamic's space systems division. since gd has restructured to only keep a very few profitable core businesses, many market pundits have been speculating gd's space business might be next to be sold. the morgan stanley report indicates gd's space systems division has some potential as a moneymaker, despite current problems -- if they can get their act together. sales are projected to be about $560 m in 1993, which will probably generate a loss of about $25 m. if gd can capture their projected share of the space launch market, and if they have managed to clean up the reliability of their atlas launchers, then they could generate healthy profits from those sales. but until they demonstrate the atlas centaur program is back on track, this division will continue to show substantial losses. in response to the sell-off rumors, in my opinion, this operation is not a really good candidate for takeover and quick profitability. to do such a takeover, the current set corporate and divisional management would be replaced with another set from outside the firm. in gd ssd's case, to get the division back on track, the management team will have to concentrate hard on the technical problems with the atlas centaur, as well as in selling atlas services. this would indicate only another firm with experience in rocket launch operations could find such talent in-house, and be able to convince customers to buy their launch services. optimally, the firm would have substantial liquid rocket experience, and experience in marketing space technology internationally as well. candidates for this might be trw, rockwell, lockheed, and martin, and possibly mcdonnell douglas and boeing. but most of those firms have cash flow problems (mdc), have had a substantial business contraction (boeing and mdc), are involved with other launch firms (lockheed), or have taken on substantial debt (martin). and coming up with the $700-1500 m purchase price for the division is a big chunk of change for any company.] 5 - ariane predicts dip in launch demand arianespace, the operator of the ariane launch system, is projecting a dip in launch demand in the late 1990's. in early february, arianespace released their annual market survey, which detailed their projection of the space transportation market for the next decade. over short run, arianespace expects to retain their dominant position and sustain a majority share of the launch market. of 54 international and commercial launches planned through 1995, ariane holds contracts for 31, general dynamics' atlas vehicle holds 14 contracts, mcdonnell douglas' delta holds 7, and great wall's long march vehicle holds 2 launch contracts. three-quarters of future launch contracts for which ariane can compete are projected to come from communications satellites with the remaining 25% split between weather, earth observation, and scientific satellites. most of the future telecommunications demand growth is predicted to come from the asia/pacific region. arianespace expects the current market consolidation of individual satellite operators into regional or national groups will continue, with these groups investing in heavier satellites with larger communications payloads carrying more transponders. arianespace predicts the average mass of telecommunications satellites should increase by 20 % over today's average level, to about 3000 kg in geo. demand for commercial launch services is expected to remain strong over the next three years, but in the second half of the decade, arianespace predicts demand will decrease. arianespace bases this prediction upon a matching of satellite transponder demand and supply, particularly as new data compression techniques appear to could double or triple transponder capacity using existing or near-term transponders. one of the significant possible changes in the market was identified as the arrival of new launch vehicles, including russian launch systems. but arianespace predicts that in the long term, investors purchasing launch services are looking for the best trade off between launch service quality and price, and that russian and other new launch services will have to prove out their capabilities and service quality, and their market penetration will be minimal. [commentary: ariane releases their market surveys annually, and i reported on their prior market survey in a past issue of csn/sti. comparing the two surveys, there aren't outstanding differences in the numbers. the most notable change is the consideration of new data compression techniques, reducing the demand for new physical transponders on orbit. i note that in contrast to some predictions, demand for space- based communications transponders appears to be remain strong. while fiber optic lines are making substantial inroads into the established point-to-point telecommunications markets, growing demand for telecommunications services world wide and for point-to- multipoint broadcast services have prevented a decrease in space transponder demand. fiberoptic cables provide a higher capability service, but only from established point a to established point b. to establish a fiberoptic link it is necessary to install cable between the points, and while there are improved network solutions, installing a large network of distributed fiberoptic links can cost millions or billions of dollars. for broadcast services where there is not an existing ground network structure, satellites still offer the most cost effective solution. and if new services are required into a new region, it is cheaper to install a small satellite link costing only a few tens of thousands of dollars and tie into the existing global satellite network. this allows rapid growth of new satellite services, and has kept demand high. the replacement market for fiberoptics is growing as well, since as demand grows between the points serviced, it becomes cost effective to later install a fiberoptic link to handle the increase in traffic. since the telecommunications and data transfer markets are still growing rapidly, satellite market projections remain rosy. but satellites are also getting longer orbital lifetimes. current generation satellites are now getting guarantees of at 15 years of on-orbit service or more, in contrast to 10 years of service from last generation's satellites. this has cut back some of the launch demand, as satellite owners are rescheduling replacement satellite launches over longer intervals. and as last note; arianespace didn't flag it this year, but it looks like the space transportation market will be rather over- supplied by existing launch systems in the near term. the annual commercial launch demand is for about 15-20 medium sized satellites per year. from the supply side, ariane is capable of launching up to about a dozen medium sized satellites a year, delta is capable of about 9-12 per year, atlas is capable of 6-12, long march 4-8, japan's h-vehicle 2-4, russia's proton capable of 8, and other systems such as zenit and soyuz another 10-20 medium launches per year. that's a lot of capability for a small market. we can only expect the competition to intensify for commercial launches.] 6- ntsb investigates pegasus launch over aborted abort the 9 feb pegasus launch by orbital sciences corporation has spawned an investigation over an apparent violation of range safety rules. a valid abort order from a nasa range safety officer to halt the mission was overridden and the pegasus was launched in violation of range safety rules. in the last few minutes of the pegasus launch countdown, one of two abort command receivers aboard the pegasus failed. such a failure typically scrubs a launch,and a nasa range safety officer at wallops island, va issued a mission abort order about a minute before the scheduled pegasus launch. somehow this command was overridden by the osc launch team or the message was lost in the communications channels, and the pegasus was launched despite the valid abort call. fortunately, the pegasus functioned as expected, and the abort command receiver was not needed. but this incident did spark an investigation since a valid abort order was given under agreed-to launch constraint rules, and was not obeyed. leading the investigation is the national transportation safety board (ntsb) with support from nasa, osc, and the air force. this investigation marks the first time ntsb has taken the lead on an incident involving a space launch. according to the ntsb, their investigation will take about 6 months, and is primarily looking at lines of authority, communications links and safety procedures used in the launch. [commentary: this is the first time that the ntsb has led an investigation into a space launch. their leadership was requested by the department of commerce's office of commercial space transportation, who had licensed the commercial launch. at the time of writing this column, some of the initial investigations have been concluded, and some of the results are starting to leak out into the trade press. apparently, 3 or four different communications channels were in use during the test. after the abort destruct receiver stopped responding, the nasa test director and range controller in the mission control room at wallops island gave abort orders about a minute before the launch. according to the mission rules, this should have stopped the launch. somehow, the osc test conductor ordered the abort reversed, and the nasa communicator on the net relayed that order to the b-52 carrying the pegasus at about 22 seconds before launch. differing explainations of exactly how this happened are proposed -- with the best set being that clear lines of communications and clear definition of the responsibilities of the mission control team, and understanding of the mission rules were not established before the launch. as we see more and more commercial launches, more of these procedural issues are going to crop up and will have to be resolved. this case is interesting because it is the first time the ntsb has been called in to investigate a commercial launch problem (as they do with commercial aircraft problems). i think this problem will turn out to be primarily problems with procedures and communications, and will be cleared up with issuance of guidelines on how launch communications should be set up and how specific lines of authority should be delineated.] 7- another pegasus competitor is announced tsniimach enterprise in russia announced it is marketing a new small space launch system, based upon converted icbm components. two versions of the launcher are being marketed: the \"aerokosmos\" winged vehicle launched like the osc pegasus, and the \"severkosmos\", launched from a mobile ground transporter. the aerokosmos is projected to deliver 900 kg to a 200 km circular orbit or 580 kg to an 800 km circular orbit, and the severkosmos to be capable of 430 kg to 200 km orbits and 225 kg to 800 km. also proposed to be used with these launch systems is a leo data relay system called 'sineva'. tsniimach enterprise is described as a ex-military establishment, focusing on aerodynamics and thermal protection of spacecraft and which has participated in the development of the buran shuttle system, they are located near the npo energia facility in kaliningrad, outside of moscow. [commentary: there's very little released information on this new venture. my suspicion is it is another russian enterprise looking for hard currency and trying to capitalize upon their in-house knowledge of ex-soviet launch systems. it adds to the list of numerous commercial space startups announced from the ex-soviet union. this one's a little different in that they are offering variants of ex-soviet icbms, but i can't identify any key customers being targeted or substantial financial backing.] 8- georgia launch site dropped from planning in late january, georgia tech research institute released the results of a preliminary study on the feasibility of a commercial rocket launching site in camden county, georgia at the old kingsland missile test launching site on the atlantic coast. the preliminary study recommended the site not be pursued as a commercial launch site, stating reopening the site was not feasible due to projected low investment returns, plus environmental and other geographic considerations. however, the report did say the site might be ideal for other aerospace uses, and recommended other potential uses. [commentary: this should put the nails in the coffin of the kingsland commercial launch site. while other sites are still proceeding with commercial launch site development plans, kingsland found without a key customer to act as anchor tenant, and if substantial infrastructure had to be put in, then the expected returns were too low to justify the cost of development. this might point out some key discriminators in judging the feasibility of a commercial launch site. these include: - is there an identified key customer to provide core usage sufficient to recover setup costs? - is there a market advantage of using the site? - can existing infrastructure be used or modified at the site? - can financing be found at low enough cost to support the investment? other commercial launch site ventures -- including those at woomera, poker flat, cape york, white sands, alabama off-shore platform, hawaii, and vandenberg have to also be judged against these criteria. in my opinion, some of these ventures are flying on hope and speculation, and not on sound financial grounds.] 9- spain's capricornia launcher still proceeding in one of his last official acts, former president bush authorized space technology transfer for several joint space ventures between us and other firms. one of these was a proposed use of us technology by spain to build a small booster. with that regulatory impediment removed, the 3-stage capricornia launch vehicle will start development later this year, planning for a first launch in the 1995/96 time period. the capricornia is described as a small 3-stage all solid booster designed to put 250-500 kg into leo. several launch sites are being examined for the system, including 2 on the iberian peninsula and 1 on the canary islands. originated by inta in spain, the project reports it has $ 30 m in development funding, and will use technology from argentina's condor launch vehicle as well as from the us. [commentary: several firms have identified a market opportunity in providing a small launcher for the european market. small payloads from european firms or organizations currently use either ariane piggyback launches or the us/italian scout launcher. however, ariane piggyback opportunities are limited, and the scout program is being phased out (accompanied by some disarray in the italian government and space industry regarding any follow-on system). this has left an apparent niche for a new european small launch system. surprisingly enough, esa has not supported development of such a system within the current space funding structure. studies have been performed by british aerospace, aerospatiale, deutsche aerospace, and italian organizations, but with the exception of the swedish/pacastro system (reported below), i have not been able to find any other european development work with even a rumor of funding for hardware. also of interest is the linking of the capricornia to the argentinian condor launcher. there have been some interesting rumors surfacing out of argentina over the past year about a space launcher/irbm program funded under the military junta which ruled the country in the 1970's and early 1980's. what is known is in feb 1992, the argentinian air force formally transferred control of the condor 2 missile program to the new civilian argentinian national space agency (comison nacional de atividades espaciales - cnae). the condor 2 program was described as originating in 1983, expanding upon the smaller condor 1 rocket program in collaboration with egypt and with support of german firms. the condor 2 was also reportedly funded indirectly by iraq in the mid-1980's. fairly large solid rocket motors were built and tested, but argentinan development of a suitable guidance package lagged that of the propulsion system. it should be noted cnae is planning to launch its first scientific satellite in late 1994. the us$ 9 m, 181 kg, sac-b satellite will study the earth's upper atmosphere and includes cooperative experiments from italy and the us. no launch vehicle has yet been selected, but osc's pegasus and the russian burlak air launched rocket are reported to be strong contenders for this contract.] 10- pacastro signs launch reservation with swedish space corp pacastro, a small launch firm in herndon, virginia announced in late february it had received a $6 m launch reservation contract from the swedish space corp to launch a satellite on pacastro's pa-2 launch vehicle. this will be performed as part of the polar satellite service (pss), a joint norwegian space center/ swedish space corp. program to upgrade the andoya rocket range in norway and offering small satellite launches into the polar regions. according to pacastro, pss is also performing an $8 m upgrade of the andoya launch facilities, including a new integration facility and a fully- enclosed vertical assembly building for small launch vehicles like the pacastro pa-2. pacastro has been chosen as \"the main alternative rocket supplier\" for the small satellite launch service to be offered by pss from andoya. the date of the launch of the swedish satellite was not specified. [commentary: pacastro has been trying to line up customers and funding for their launch vehicle for some time now. the pa-2 is a small, two stage rocket fueled by rp-1 and liquid oxygen. from pacastro's literature, the engines designed for the pa-series rockets are built of \"off the shelf\" components based upon the lunar module descent engines built by trw, and are capable of putting a 225 kg satellite into a 750 km circular polar orbit. pacastro is trying to arrange construction financing for its first three pa-2 vehicles, with a first launch planned for 1995, and 2 orbital launches planned for 1996. my records show pacastro hired trw to provide marketing support and systems design, with primary engineering to be done by aeroastro, a small satellite builder closely associated with pacastro (headquartered in the same building). the swedish space corporation would supply engineering, launch operations, vehicle subsystems, and marketing support. sumitomo corp. of tokyo, is a first round investor and sits on the board of directors. pacastro has gotten a first round financial package of at least $550 k (some sources place this of high as $1 m), but has been searching for about a year for the additional $20-30 m needed to design, build and launch their first set of vehicles. the launch reservation from ssc can possibly be used to help bring some investors on board, but by my estimate, they will need much more than the single $6 m sale to put their venture into real hardware.] 11- china and taiwan joint satellite venture reported in early march, it was reported a joint satellite communications venture between a taiwanese and mainland chinese was in the works. as reported in the taipei press, china development corp. (cdc), headquartered in taiwam and with links to the ruling nationalist party, is planning to set up a joint venture in hong kong with china great wall industry corp. with the objective of launching a regional communications satellite. cdc would cover about 10% of the satellite system cost (us $10 m) in exchange for rights to 10% of the satellite's communications channels. [commentary: this announcement came close on the heels of the release of taiwanese plans for space development (released in mid january). in those plans, the national space program office of taiwan will launch 3 satellites, starting with rocsat-1, a 400 kg scientific spacecraft, planned for launch in 1997. two additional satellites are planned, both communications satellites. trw has been helping taiwan plan this program, budgeted at t$13.6 b (us $530 m) through 2006. i haven't been able to establish any relationship between this venture and those of the nspot, but there might be a connection. while taiwan has the financing to pursue several ventures, the current taiwanese telecommunications market might not support two separate sastellite ventures. the reported name for the tiawanese/chinese system is \"asiasat- 2\", but i don't thinks this has any relationship with the existing hong kong-based \"asiasat\" program involving chinese, hong kong, and other asian investors, other than using it as an organizational model. there are some obvious advantages to pursuing such a joing venture -- it could provide excellent first-hand experience to taiwan for a very low cost, which then can be used in later satellite ventures. but there are internal political issues between taiwanese and chinese ventures, but putting any joint venture through a hong kong intermediary corporation might allow it to proceed. in any case, the east asian satellite market is lighting up with substantially growth projected in space services and revenues. this is just another indicator to add to the list.] 12- south korea announces national move into space technologies south korea's trade, industry and resources ministry recently announced plans to invest us$22 b in research and development and another us$17 b into manufacturing and research facilities for advanced aerospace technologies. space technologies have been specifically targeted as part of this program, beginning with manufacture and launch of an advanced multi-purpose satellite by 1997. the objective of this investment is to raise south korea's aerospace technology to the level of the world's top 10 countries by 2000. [commentary: south korea has been quietly working to develop its national aerospace industry, specifically including space activities. i'm noting this as a flag that potential new players are coming into the commercial space market. as part of their national effort, 2 national telecommunications satellites for korea telecom will be launched in april and oct 1995 on delta. designated koreasat 1 and 2, the platforms will provide television and telephone service throughout the korean peninsula, southwestern japan and portions of china bordering north korea. south korea launched its first small satellite piggyback on ariane in aug 1992, called uribyol-1 (our star) and costing about us $8.8 m. uribyol-2 is planned for piggyback launch in october of this year, again on ariane, and will be entirely \"made in korea.\" uribyol-3, projected for a 1995 launch, will be an environment- monitoring micro-satellite. this satellite may be the precursor to a series of small earth observation satellites, the keos (korean earth observation system) project, which has been submitted for approval to the south korean government, would use two or three 300-kg spacecraft equipped with optical and microwave sensors. south korean press reports claim there is also a parallel military effort to establish the capabilities for building and launching small military satellites by 2001. supposedly a government panel had been established to oversee such an effort, funded at us $ 500 m between 1993 and 2001, in anticipation of an expected pullout of u.s. intelligence-gathering systems from the korean peninsula. in conjunction with all of these reported efforts, south korean is also pursuing production work either as off-sets to existing aerospace technology contracts (for example, mcdonnell douglas is offsetting production of some delta parts to south korean firms as part of the koreasat launch contracts), or for production of consumer space items (among other products, south korea exports satellite receiver television setups to japan, and samsung has announced teaming for production of osc's orbcomm user terminals.). this looks like a very aggressive push into space technologies. considering that east asia is currently the fastest growing sector for commercial space services (primarily for telecommunications), a south korean push into space technologies may change the composition of commercial space market there over the next decade.] 13- space technology indexes through march as announced in the last csn/sti, each issue will give the results of stock indexes and portfolios regarding space stocks and investments. the table below summarizes results to the end of march. the space technology index did quite a bit better than the market as a whole, as represented by the s&p 500 index. since 90+% of the values included in the index are us firms, this represents a general increase in the market value of space-related firms. the increase in the first quarter is more than in all of 1992 -- which is a very promising sign, although future months may reverse this trend. the commercial space technology index has also done quite well, but the pure play portfolio -- consisting of stocks of firms which are pure plays in space technologies -- has also surpassed its results in all of 1993. we'll keep an eye on these .... index results through march beginning beginning 1 jan 93 to 1992 1993 31 mar 1993 ------- -------- -------- s&p 500 416 436 (+4.7%) 452 (+3.7%) space tech index 267 304 (+13.6%) 373 (+22.7%) comm'l space tech index 167 194 (+16.3%) 222 (+14.2%) space tech pure plays 147 169 (+15.4%) 197 (+16.2%) final notes - what? this column's already full? and i still have bunches of commercial space developments to report on. as i said at the start of this, column there's been a lot of interesting happenings - but i'll have to put them into the next issue. looking ahead, i've got several articles in the works on new happenings with iridium and the leo communications satellite market, more news on international launchers appearing (and disappearing) on the market, new international commercial space ventures, and other interesting developments. and as always, i hope you folks find this stuff useful and interesting -- any and all comments are welcome.",

            "there are some issues which come to mind when one considers the law enforcement aspects of the use of the big brother (clipper) chip. the drug dealers and terrorists aren't going to let themselves be caught by using this type of encryption. in 1985 the new york times reported that government investigators broke up a narcotics ring that was operating highly sophisticated equipment capable of allowing the leaders of the ring to eavesdrop on the law-enforcement agents who were trying to arrest them. a mr. deely, an nsa official, said \"there are a lot of medium-sized countries that would have been proud to have the signals intelligence operation of this group.\" for every john gotti there are probably many more people who have the sophistication to know what the risks of unsecure communications are. the press given to the big brother chip will only increase their numbers. even if there is some benefit to law-enforcement through the use of big brother, it must be weighed against the constitutional and civil liberties questions involved. for example, in some areas of the world torture is used as an investigative tool by the local \"law-enforcement\" people. i suspect it is an effective means of obtaining information and shortening many investigations. it probably also helps keep the conviction rate high. the fact that the torture tool is not used in this country (even with a court order obtained by showing \"probable cause\") is because we have rightly balanced the questions of expediency and what is ethically and morally right. i think that the same question of expediency versus morality should come into play when considering the use of big brother. i vote for morality. i am quite disturbed by what i interpret as a veiled threat to prohibit the use of all encryption if this big brother chip is not put into wide spread use. after a quick reading of the white house press release i came away with that impression. to most of the american public, the word \"hacker\" has rightly or wrongly come to mean \"high tech adolescent vandal\". it has struck me that most of the people posting to sci.crypt regarding this issue are intelligent, thoughtful individuals who have genuine concerns about the privacy and constitutional issues surrounding big brother. i hope that the use of big brother does not become mandatory and other encryption become illegal. i would hate to see this become some kind of high tech volstead act. the high speed digital communications revolution is coming at us with the speed of an sst. the times they are a changing, and just as ibm is learning that they can't do business the same way they have done it for the past 40 years, maybe nsa should evaluate another approach. eff, who have correctly questioned the cryptographic strength of big brother, may need to send a stronger message out regarding the constitutional issues involved. al gore may want to think this one through a little more. and as for dorothy elizabeth robling denning: en quoi cela vous concerne, cheri?",

            "heres a nice story to help explain the virtues of purity, innocence and modesty, and their importance. the most beautiful virtues this story is an excerpt taken from the basket of flowers by johann christoph von schmid in a certain little market town, over a hundred years ago, there lived an upright and intelligent man named jacob rede. he was married to a most virtuous young woman and they lived happily in a humble home which was in the midst of a large, beautiful val- ley. after living many, happy years together, jacob's wife died, leaving him alone with only one friend...his daughter mary. even as a child mary was uncommonly pretty; but as she grew in years, her piety, her innocence, her modesty and her unfeigned kindne ss towards all she came in contact with, gave to her beauty a rare and peculiar charm. her face was lighted up with a look of such indescribable goodness, that it seemed almost as though one looked upon an angel. mary's greatest delight was the beautiful garden and her favour- ite flowers were the violet, the lily and the rose. jacob loved to point to them as emblems of the virtues most becoming to her gender. when she once, early in march brought the first violet to let the modest violet, my dear mary, be to you an image of humil- ity and of the benevolence that does good in secret. it clothes itself in the tender colours of modesty; it prefers to bloom in retired grots; it fills the air with its fragrance while remain- ing hidden beneath the leaves. may you also, my dear mary, be like the retiring violet, avoiding vain display, not seeking to attract the public eye, but preferring ever to do good in quietude and peace. one morning when the roses and lilies were in full bloom and the garden appeared in its richest array, jacob said to his daughter, as he pointed out a beautiful lily, which was beaming in the morning sun: let the lily my dear child, be to you the emblem of purity. look how beautiful, how pure and fair it is! the whi- test linen is as nothing compared with the purity of its petals: they are like the snow. happy the maiden whose heart is as pure and as free from stain. but the purest of all colours is also the hardest -5- to preserve pure. easily is the petal of the lily soiled; touch it but carelessly or roughly and a stain is left behind. in the same way, a word or a thought may stain the purity of innocence! let the rose my dear mary, be to you an emblem of modesty. more beautiful than the colour of the rose is the blush that rises to the cheek of a modest girl. it is a sign that she is still pure of heart and innocent in thought. happy is the maiden whom the suggestion of a thought that is indelicate, will cause to blush, as she is thus put on her guard against the approach of danger. the cheeks which readily blush will remain for a long time with their roseate hue, while those which fail to blush at the least indelicacy of thought will soon become pale and wan, and go before their time to the grave.\" among the many fruit trees that adorned the garden there was one that was prized above all the others. it was an apple tree, not much larger than a rose bush, and stood by itself in the middle of the garden. mary's father had planted it the day that she was born and every year it bore a number of beautiful apples. once it blossomed earlier than usual and with unusual luxuriance. the tree was one mass of blossom. mary was so delighted with it that she went every morning as soon as she was dressed to look at it. once, when it was in full bloom, she called to her father look father, how beautiful! was there ever such a lovely mingling of red and white? the whole tree looks like one huge bunch of flowers! the next morning she hastened into the garden to feast her eyes once more upon the tree. but what was her grief to see that the frost had nipped it and destroyed all its flowers. they were all become brown and yellow and when the sun came forth in its strength they withered and fell to the ground. mary wept bitter tears at the sight. then said the father: thus, does sinful pleasure destroy the bloom of youth. oh my child, never cease to remember how dreadful it is to be seduced from the path of right! behold in the example of the apple tree an image of what would happen if you were to wander from the way - if the hopes your conduct hitherto has raised in my heart should vanish, not merely for a day or year, but for life. ah, then how much more bitter would be the tears which i would shed over your lapse from virtue than those which now course down your cheeks! life would have no joys for me: with tears in my eyes i should -6- go down sorrowfully to my grave. as he spoke, the tears stood in his eyes; mary was deeply moved, and the words he uttered made so profound an impression upon her mind that she never forgot them. under the eyes of a father so loving and wise, and amid the flowers of her garden, mary grew daily in stature and intelli- gence - blooming as a rose, pure as a lily and retiring as a violet, and as full of promise as a tree laden with blossom. happy was the old man at all times to behold how plenteously the fruits of his garden rewarded his diligent toil; but with how much more happiness and content did he mark the gracious effect produced upon the heart and mind of his beloved daughter by his pious teaching and example. jacob plucked several roses and lilies, tied them together in a bunch and gave them to mary with the words: the lily and the rose, sister flowers as they are, belong the one to the other; both incomparable in their beauty, they are ren- dered still more lovely by being together. in the same way my dear child are innocence and modesty twin sisters of virtue and cannot be separated the greatest and most powerful guardian of purity is the thought of the presence of god",

            "> i would rather spend an eternity in hell than be beside god in > heaven knowing that even one man would spend his \"eternal life\" > being scorched for his wrongdoings.... stephen, i suspect that when you and i use the word \"hell,\" we have different concepts in mind. when you encounter references to heaven in terms of crowns and harps and golden streets, i trust that you do not suppose (or suspect christians of supposing) that the golden streets are to be taken literally, still less that they are what the concept of heaven is all about. why then should you suppose that about the \"fires\" of hell? have you read the novel atlas shrugged? do you remember the last description of james taggart, sitting on the floor beside the ferris persuader? this comes close to a description of what is meant by hell in my circles. if the image of fire is often used in this connection, there are two reasons that occur to me. the first reason is that it conveys the idea of hell as something that any rational being would earnestly wish to avoid (as any rational being would wish to avoid the fate of james taggart -- but the latter image is meaningful only to those who have read atlas shrugged, a smaller audience than those who have played with matches). the second reason is the history of the hebrew word \"gehenna,\" one of the words translated \"hell\" in the new testament. it refers to the valley of hinnon, outside jerusalem. in early days, it was a place where the canaanites offered human sacrifices (burned alive) to molech. later, it was made a garbage or refuse dump, where fires burned continually, consuming the trash of the city of jerusalem. \"to be cast into gehenna\" or \"to burn in gehenna\" thus became a metaphor for \"to be rejected or discarded as worthless.\" lest you think that identifying hell with the fate of james taggart is my own private fancy, i commend to you the book the great divorce, by c s lewis. it discusses heaven (no harps) and hell (no flames). it is shorter than atlas shrugged, and available at most bookstores and libraries.",

            "i feel compelled to complain: the statement that recent observations rule out merging neutron stars as sources of gamma-ray bursts is utterly false, even though it is popular enough to make it to batse press releases. the idea behind the statement is as follows: \"if you smack two neutron stars together, or have a neutron star be gobbled up by a black hole, a lot of energy is released, enough for a gamma-ray burst at a cosmological distance. but, so the reasoning continues, this energy is released below a lot of matter, so the radiation becomes thermalized and you expect to see roughly a blackbody spectrum. the observed spectra are strongly non-thermal, so this model must be wrong.\" as so often, the fault lies with the imagination of the person who was trying to prove the model wrong rather than with the model. it may be that the initial energy release is not seen as a gamma-ray burst, but the 'fireball' of energy and matter that is created may spew out a relativistic flow. when this slams into the surrounding medium, a strong flux of non-thermal gamma rays results, which may carry off a substantial fraction of the initial total energy. all this is not my idea: it is in a series of papers by martin rees, peter meszaros (sorry for the missing accents:-) and co-workers. it is certainly not a complete model, but it may well be the best one around (summing over all proposed distance scales). an alternative proposal for what creates the initial fireball, by the way, is the so-called 'failed supernovae' scenario by stan woosley, in which a very massive star at the end of its life collapses to a black hole. if the stellar core was rotating, part of the infalling matter will be temporarily halted because it is supported by centrifugal force, and form a very dense neutron torus that accretes onto the black hole. this beast may spew out a jet along the rotation axis, which again constitutes relativistic flow. the rate of such events may be much higher than that of neutron star mergers, but the flux may be more strongly beamed, so that the net rate of bursts observed on earth stays the same between the two scenarios, but the energy released per event can be a lot less in the failed supernova scenario. on another note: i do believe that the distance scale must ultimately be resolved via some classical astronomical method such as finding counterparts to the bursts at other wavelengths, or finding a definitive signature of some known class of objects in the distribution of positions and fluxes. theorists have historically not been too successfull in finding the distance of any object by proving that there is only one possible way in which the object can work, and therefore it *must* be so-and-so.",
            "there are several reasons for this difference. the main reason is that good hitters in their prime (such as frank thomas and danny tartabull) are rarely regular dh's, even if they can't field; it's more commonly a place to put aging veterans. another use of the dh slot is to help a player come back from injury slowly, getting his bat in the lineup without forcing him to play in the field. i would expect such players to hit worse as dh's than they did during the rest of the season. a third factor is that most player who split time between dh and first or the outfield don't hit as well as dh's for some reason. reggie jackson was a good example; in five years as a rf/dh for the angels, he hit like the old reggie when he was in right. the second and third factors will be lost if players are considered by their primary position only; a player who plays 90 games in right and 60 at dh will count only in the right fielders' averages. this makes sense; you might also look at it another way. although the *average* offensive performance of a dh may be lower than for a left fielder, the *replacement-level* offensive performance is certainly lower; if you are a left fielder but can't hit well enough to keep a job anywhere, then you certainly can't hit well enough to keep a job at dh.",

_________________________________________________________________ for immediate release april 16, 1993 statement by the press secretary the president today announced a new initiative that will bring the federal government together with industry in a voluntary program to improve the security and privacy of telephone communications while meeting the legitimate needs of law enforcement. the initiative will involve the creation of new products to accelerate the development and use of advanced and secure telecommunications networks and wireless communications links. for too long there has been little or no dialogue between our private sector and the law enforcement community to resolve the tension between economic vitality and the real challenges of protecting americans. rather than use technology to accommodate the sometimes competing interests of economic growth, privacy and law enforcement, previous policies have pitted government against industry and the rights of privacy against law enforcement. sophisticated encryption technology has been used for years to protect electronic funds transfer. it is now being used to protect electronic mail and computer files. while encryption technology can help americans protect business secrets and the unauthorized release of personal information, it also can be used by terrorists, drug dealers, and other criminals. a state-of-the-art microcircuit called the \"clipper chip\" has been developed by government engineers. the chip represents a new approach to encryption technology. it can be used in new, relatively inexpensive encryption devices that can be attached to an ordinary telephone. it scrambles telephone communications using an encryption algorithm that is more powerful than many in commercial use today. this new technology will help companies protect proprietary information, protect the privacy of personal phone conversations and prevent unauthorized release of data transmitted electronically. at the same time this technology preserves the ability of federal, state and local law enforcement agencies to intercept lawfully the phone conversations of criminals. a \"key-escrow\" system will be established to ensure that the \"clipper chip\" is used to protect the privacy of law-abiding americans. each device containing the chip will have two unique 2 \"keys,\" numbers that will be needed by authorized government agencies to decode messages encoded by the device. when the device is manufactured, the two keys will be deposited separately in two \"key-escrow\" data bases that will be established by the attorney general. access to these keys will be limited to government officials with legal authorization to conduct a wiretap. the \"clipper chip\" technology provides law enforcement with no new authorities to access the content of the private conversations of americans. to demonstrate the effectiveness of this new technology, the attorney general will soon purchase several thousand of the new devices. in addition, respected experts from outside the government will be offered access to the confidential details of the algorithm to assess its capabilities and publicly report their findings. the chip is an important step in addressing the problem of encryption's dual-edge sword: encryption helps to protect the privacy of individuals and industry, but it also can shield criminals and terrorists. we need the \"clipper chip\" and other approaches that can both provide law-abiding citizens with access to the encryption they need and prevent criminals from using it to hide their illegal activities. in order to assess technology trends and explore new approaches (like the key-escrow system), the president has directed government agencies to develop a comprehensive policy on encryption that accommodates: -- the privacy of our citizens, including the need to employ voice or data encryption for business purposes; -- the ability of authorized officials to access telephone calls and data, under proper court or other legal order, when necessary to protect our citizens; -- the effective and timely use of the most modern technology to build the national information infrastructure needed to promote economic growth and the competitiveness of american industry in the global marketplace; and -- the need of u.s. companies to manufacture and export high technology products. the president has directed early and frequent consultations with affected industries, the congress and groups that advocate the privacy rights of individuals as policy options are developed. 3 the administration is committed to working with the private sector to spur the development of a national information infrastructure which will use new telecommunications and computer technologies to give americans unprecedented access to information. this infrastructure of high-speed networks (\"information superhighways\") will transmit video, images, hdtv programming, and huge data files as easily as today's telephone system transmits voice. since encryption technology will play an increasingly important role in that infrastructure, the federal government must act quickly to develop consistent, comprehensive policies regarding its use. the administration is committed to policies that protect all americans' right to privacy while also protecting them from those who break the law. further information is provided in an accompanying fact sheet. the provisions of the president's directive to acquire the new encryption technology are also available. for additional details, call mat heyman, national institute of standards and technology, (301) 975-2758. - - --------------------------------- questions and answers about the clinton administration's telecommunications initiative q: does this approach expand the authority of government agencies to listen in on phone conversations? a: no. \"clipper chip\" technology provides law enforcement with no new authorities to access the content of the private conversations of americans. q: suppose a law enforcement agency is conducting a wiretap on a drug smuggling ring and intercepts a conversation encrypted using the device. what would they have to do to decipher the message? a: they would have to obtain legal authorization, normally a court order, to do the wiretap in the first place. they would then present documentation of this authorization to the two entities responsible for safeguarding the keys and obtain the keys for the device being used by the drug smugglers. the key is split into two parts, which are stored separately in order to ensure the security of the key escrow system. q: who will run the key-escrow data banks? a: the two key-escrow data banks will be run by two independent entities. at this point, the department of justice and the administration have yet to determine which agencies will oversee the key-escrow data banks. q: how strong is the security in the device? how can i be sure how strong the security is? a: this system is more secure than many other voice encryption systems readily available today. while the algorithm will remain classified to protect the security of the key escrow system, we are willing to invite an independent panel of cryptography experts to evaluate the algorithm to assure all potential users that there are no unrecognized vulnerabilities. q: whose decision was it to propose this product? a: the national security council, the justice department, the commerce department, and other key agencies were involved in this decision. this approach has been endorsed by the president, the vice president, and appropriate cabinet officials. q: who was consulted? the congress? industry? a: we have on-going discussions with congress and industry on encryption issues, and expect those discussions to intensify as we carry out our review of encryption policy. we have briefed members of congress and industry leaders on the decisions related to this initiative. q: will the government provide the hardware to manufacturers? a: the government designed and developed the key access encryption microcircuits, but it is not providing the microcircuits to product manufacturers. product manufacturers can acquire the microcircuits from the chip manufacturer that produces them. q: who provides the \"clipper chip\"? a: mykotronx programs it at their facility in torrance, california, and will sell the chip to encryption device manufacturers. the programming function could be licensed to other vendors in the future. q: how do i buy one of these encryption devices? a: we expect several manufacturers to consider incorporating the \"clipper chip\" into their devices. q: if the administration were unable to find a technological solution like the one proposed, would the administration be willing to use legal remedies to restrict access to more powerful encryption devices? a: this is a fundamental policy question which will be considered during the broad policy review. the key escrow mechanism will provide americans with an encryption product that is more secure, more convenient, and less expensive than others readily available today, but it is just one piece of what must be the comprehensive approach to encryption technology, which the administration is developing. the administration is not saying, \"since encryption threatens the public safety and effective law enforcement, we will prohibit it outright\" (as some countries have effectively done); nor is the u.s. saying that \"every american, as a matter of right, is entitled to an unbreakable commercial encryption product.\" there is a false \"tension\" created in the assessment that this issue is an \"either-or\" proposition. rather, both concerns can be, and in fact are, harmoniously balanced through a reasoned, balanced approach such as is proposed with the \"clipper chip\" and similar encryption techniques. q: what does this decision indicate about how the clinton administration's policy toward encryption will differ from that of the bush administration? a: it indicates that we understand the importance of encryption technology in telecommunications and computing and are committed to working with industry and public-interest groups to find innovative ways to protect americans' privacy, help businesses to compete, and ensure that law enforcement agencies have the tools they need to fight crime and terrorism. q: will the devices be exportable? will other devices that use the government hardware?",

[ic] suppose, a large group of people of one of such area decides, [ic] that the us \"government is not representing their interests, and vote for [ic] seperation\" from the usa. the armenians you refer to have chosen to come to the united states lawfully and peacefully. however, if armenians invade the united states and force americans to either flee or become armenians, it will not succeed. similarly, the armenians of karabakh are being forced by azerbaijan to either become azeris or leave, and it also will not succeed, as has been demonstrated. karabakh, irrespective of its geographic position situated technically within the stalin-prepared borders of azerbaijan, has been long oppressed and eventually was invaded in 1991 by azeri omon and soviet forces, resulting in the northern third of this armenian area being depopulated of armenians. the armenians have been fighting back ever since. clearly, you feel it rather ridiculous for armenians, of let's say glendale, california, to engage in an independence movement for a free and independent glendale. similarly, the azerbaijanis are engaging in a losing attempt at claiming sovereignty over the land and people of karabakh, who have lived continuously in karabakh a thousand years before the first central asian invaders ever stepped foot in the caucasus.

            "i am asking you to believe in things not visible. i don't know if this is believeing blindly or not. i'm not sure how blindness comes into it. i do not deny reason, indeed i insist upon it, but reason only draws conclusions from evidence. if you decide in advance that your reason will act only on the evidence of the five physical senses, then you cut reason off from any possibility of reaching a conclusion outside the physical sphere (beyond the rather provocative, if inconclusive, conclusion that the physical sphere is not self explanatory). christians claim that they have received a different kind of evidence, which they call faith, and which is a gift of god. that is, this evidence is the evidence of a thing which chooses to reveal or hide itself. the evidence of the senses cannot tell you is such a ting exists. reasoning on the evidence of the senses won't help either. but christians do reason of the evidence of faith, and do claim that this evidence is wholly consistent with the evidence of the other senses, and indeed, that the evidence of these other senses is part of god's revelation of himself to us. it is not necessarilly the case however that knowledge of a god must come through this route. there may be other senses than the physical ones providing evidence of non-physical realities. (there may, of course, be physical realities of a type for which we have no corresponding senses, for all we know.) these senses, if they exist, may provide valid evidence for reason to work on. and, as with all senses, these senses may be impaired in some people, that is, they may be spiritually blind. in this sense, belief in god becomes an act of sight, and it is disbelief which is blind. faith, as i have said, is not opposed to reason, it is simply a new source of evidence on which reason may operate. it is clear that human beings have many systems for explaining the evidence of the physical senses, and similarly there are many systems for explaining the evidence provided by faith. religious believers in general, and christians in particular, use reason to help sift through the evidence to come to a clearer understanding of the evidence provided by faith. science claims, with good reason, to be the most valid system for explaining the physical universe, and christianity claims, also with good reason, to be the most valid system, possessed of the best evidence, for explaining gods revelations of himself to man. if you doubt that christians use reason, read this newsgroup for a while and you will see rational debate aplenty.",

            "a few points about mary's being taken into heaven at the end of her life on earth: one piece of evidence for mary's assumption into heaven is the fact that no christian church ever claimed to be the sight where she was buried. some christian churches claimed to be located at the final resting places of peter, mark, and other saints, but no one ever claimed to possess the body of mary, the greatest of the saints. why? because everyone knew that she had been taken up into heaven. although there is no definitive scriptural proof for the assumption of mary, some passages seem suggestive, like the passage in revelation that describes a woman giving birth to a son and later being crowned in the heavens. of course, the woman in this passage has other interpretations; she can also be taken a symbol for the church. the assumption of mary makes sense because of her relationship to christ. jesus, perfect god and perfect man, fulfilled the requirements of the law perfectly. under the law god gave to us, we are to honor our mother and father, and christ's act of taking his mother into heaven is part of his fulfillment of that law. also, he took his flesh from her, so it seems appropriate that he decide not to allow her flesh to rot in the grave. one last point: an ex-catholic attempted to explain catholic doctrine on the assumption by asserting it is connected to a belief that mary did not die. this is not a correct summary of what catholics believe. the dogma of the assumption was carefully phrased to avoid saying whether mary did or did not die. in fact, the consensus among catholic theologians seems to be that mary in fact did die. this would make sense: christ died, and his mother, who waited at the foot of the cross, would want to share in his death.",
            "isaackuo@skippy.berkeley.edu (isaac kuo) states in reply to deleted article about no-knock searches, arrests in general no-knock raids are to preserve evidence, like drugs, which can be flushed down the toilet. they are not the standard way to arrest a violent felon like a bank robber. if there is no need to search or preserve evidence they will just surround the dwelling and order the suspect to come out with her hands up. if the suspect does not come out tear gas will be used. comment on the bd omitted it is not a method to apprehend criminals. it is a very dangerous method to obtain evidence that might be destroyed if a warrant is served in the normal way. it is the most dangerous way to arrest anyone. the cops are charging into a room and they don't know what is in it. it is much safer to surround the place and announce yourself. cops are not cops _until_ they identify themselves as police officers. most drug dealers and professional criminals are aware of the likelihood of arrest but they also know how the system works. if they are arrested they call their lawyer, post bail and hope for a plea bargain. if they pull a gun and shoot a cop during a raid they will be charged with first degree murder if they survive the raid. drug dealers have guns for protection from their customers and other criminals, not to shoot cops. cops are shot on no-knock drug raids because the criminals aren't aware that they are cops. no-knock raids on homes occupied by non-criminals are more likely to end in disaster. mom and pop citizen _know_ that they have not committed any crime, they know that anyone breaking into their house cannot be a cop because they have done nothing wrong. if they have the means to defend themselves they may because they know that the housebreakers are criminals not cops. cops and homeowners may die. the first reports from waco stated that the atf had a warrant to search for illegal weapons and also an arrest warrant if the illegal weapons were found. in this case the no-knock warrant was not called for. it is difficult to flush a gun down the toilet. the atf could have surrounded the compound. a marked police car could have driven up to the entrance and uniformed officers could have knocked and served the warrant usual way. it this had happened and and koresh refused the warrant or drove the cops off at gun point then most of the t.p.g folks would have kept quiet.",

            "the number of civilian iraqi deaths were way over-exaggerated and exploited for anti-war emotionalism by the liberal news media. the facts are that less iraqis died in the gulf war than did civilians in any other war of comparable size this century! this was due mostly to the short duration coupled with precise surgical bombing techniques which were technically possible only recently. the idea that \"hundreds of thousands\" of iraqi citizens died is ludicrous. not even \"hundreds of thousands\" of iraqi soldiers died, and they were the ones being targeted! or do you think that the us and its allies were specifically out to kill and maim iraqi civilians? either the smart bombs didn't hit their targets (and we know they did), or they were targeting civilian targets (!) which is hardly condusive to destroying iraq's military potential. the military mission planners are not fools, they know they have to hit *military* targets to win a war. hitting civilian targets does nothing but unite the people against you, not a laudable goal if one wants the people to rise up against their tyrant-dictator. how about all the innocent people who died in blanket-bombing in ww2? i don't hear you bemoaning them! war is never an exact science, but with smart bombs, it's becoming more exact with a smaller percentage of civilian casualties. sometimes mistakes are made; targets are misidentified; innocents die. that's war the way it really is. but the alternative, to allow tyrannical dictators to treat the earth like it's one big rummage sale, grabbing everything they can get is worse. like patrick henry said some 217 years ago, \"i know not what course others may take -- but as for me, give me liberty, or give me death!\" war is always the price one must be willing to pay if one wishes to stay free. mathew, your sarcasm is noted but you are completely off-base here. you come off sounding like a complete peace-nik idiot, although i feel sure that was not your intent. so the iraqi war was wrong, eh? i'm sure that appeasement would have worked better than war, just like it did in ww2, eh? i guess we shouldn't have fought ww2 either -- just think of all those innocent german civilians killed in dresden and hamburg. how about all the poor french who died in the crossfire because we invaded the continent? we should have just let hitler take over europe, and you'd be speaking german instead of english right now. tyrants like hussein *have* to be stopped. his kind don't understand diplomacy; they only understand the point of a gun. my only regret is that bush wimped out and didn't have the military roll into baghdad, so now hussein is still in power and the iraqi people's sacrifice (not to mention the 357 americans who died) was for naught. liberating kuwait was a good thing, but wiping hussein off the map would've been better! and as for poor, poor rodney king! did you ever stop and think *why* the jury in the first trial brought back a verdict of \"not guilty\"? those who have been foaming at the mouth for the blood of those policemen certainly have looked no further than the video tape. but the jury looked at *all* the evidence, evidence which you and i have not seen. when one makes a judgment without the benefit of a trial where evidence can be presented on both sides, one has simply lowered himself to the level of vigilante justice, a state-of-mind which your sarcasm above seemingly spoke against, but instead tends to support in the case against the policemen. law in this country is intended to protect the rights of the accused, whether they be criminals or cops. one is not found guilty if there is a reasonable doubt of one's guilt, and only the jury is in a position to assess the evidence and render a verdict. anyone else is simply succumbing to verbal vigilantism. regards,",

(though the concept of canon is later historically.) i agree with the problem of confusion. if prophecy is meant to encourage, exhort or correct then is an overlap with scripture. if prophecy is meant to bring a `word' of the form \"the man you live with is not your husband\" then that is knowledge. yet the exact words their are scripture. i would expect the difference to be the motive and means for delivery. the reading of scripture itself can be a powerful force. regards david",

when asking for help on the net or x mailing lists, be sure to include all information about your setup and what you are doing. the more specific you are, the more likely someone will spot an error in what you are doing. without all the details, people who want to help you often have to guess -- if they are able to respond at all. always mention what version of x you are using and where you got it from. if your server came from a different source as the rest of your x system, give details of that, too. give the machine type, operating system, and o/s version for both the client and server machine. it may also be appropriate to mention the window manager, compiler, and display hardware type you are using. then tell exactly what you are doing, exactly what happens, and what you expected/wanted to happen. if it is a command that fails, include the exact transcript of your session in the message. if a program you wrote doesn't work the way you expect, include as little of the source necessary (just a small test case, please!) for readers to reproduce the problem. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- subject: 8) what publications discussing x are available? the trade magazines (unix world, unix review, computer language, etc.) are publishing more articles on x. two x-specific publications include: - o'reilly and associates publishes \"the x resource: a practical journal of the x window system\" (103 morris st. #a, sebastapol, ca 95472). editorial information: adrian nye, adrian@ora.com. - the x journal is started bi-monthly publication september 1991 on a variety of x topics. subscription information: the x journal, subscriber services, dept xxx, p.o. box 3000, denville, nj 07834, usa. editorial information: editors%topgun@uunet.uu.net. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- subject: 9) what are these common abbreviations/acronyms? xt: the x toolkit intrinsics is a library layered on xlib which provides the functionality from which the widget sets are built. an \"xt-based\" program is an application which uses one of those widget sets and which uses intrinsics mechanisms to manipulate the widgets. xmu: the xmu library is a collection of miscellaneous utility functions useful in building various applications and widgets. xaw: the athena widget set is the mit-implemented sample widget set distributed with x11 source. xm: the osf/motif widget set from the open software foundation; binary kits are available from many hardware vendors. xhp (xw): the hewlett-packard widget set was originally based on r2++, but several sets of patches exist which bring it up to r3, as it is distributed on the x11r4 tapes. supplemental patches are available to use it with r4/r5. clx: the common lisp x interface is a common lisp equivalent to xlib. xdmcp: the x display manager protocol provides a uniform mechanism for a display such as an x terminal to request login service from a remote host. xlfd: the x logical font description conventions describes a standard logical font description and conventions to be used by clients so that they can query and access those resources. rtfm: common expert-speak meaning \"please locate and consult the relevant documentation -- read the forgotten manual\". utsl: a common expression meaning \"take advantage of the fact that you aren't limited by a binary license -- use the source, luke\". api: application-programmer interface. the function calls, etc., in a programming library. bdf: bitmap distribution format; a human-readable format for uncompiled x fonts. gui: graphical user interface. uil: the user interface language, part of osf/motif which lets programmers specify a widget hierarchy in a simple \"outline\" form wcl: the widget creation language, a package which extends the understanding of the xt resource format such that a widget hierarchy and actions on the widgets can be specified through the resources file gil: the file format put out by sun's openwindows developers guide 3.0 uims: user interface management system ---------------------------------------------------------------------- subject: 10) what is the icccm? (how do i write x-friendly applications?) the inter-client communication conventions manual is one of the official x consortium standards documents that define the x environment. it describes the conventions that clients must observe to coexist peacefully with other clients sharing the same server. if you are writing x clients, you need to read and understand the icccm, in particular the sections discussing the selection mechanism and the interaction between your client and the window manager. get it either: - as part of the r4 distribution from mit - in the later editions of the scheifler/gettys \"x window system\" book - as an appendix in the new version of o'reilly's volume 0, \"x protocol reference manual.\" a version in old copies of their volume 1 is obsolete. the version in the digital press book is much more readable, thanks to the efforts of digital press's editors to improve the english and the presentation. [from david rosenthal, 10/90] - the icccm was updated for r5; updates are published in o'reilly's \"programmer's supplement for release 5\". the complete document is on the r5 tapes. alternate definition: the icccm is generally the m in \"rtfm\" and is the most-important of the least-read x documents. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- subject: 11) what is the x consortium, and how do i join? the mit x consortium was formed in january of 1988 to further the development of the x window system and has as its major goal the promotion of cooperation within the computer industry in the creation of standard software interfaces at all layers in the x window system environment. mit's role is to provide the vendor-neutral architectural and administrative leadership required to make this work. membership in the consortium open to any organization. there are two categories of membership, member (for large organizations) and affiliate (for smaller organizations). most of the consortium's activities take place via electronic mail, with meetings when required. as designs and specifications take shape, interest groups are formed from experts in the participating organizations. typically a small multi-organization architecture team leads the design, with others acting as close observers and reviewers. once a complete specification is produced, it may be submitted for formal technical review by the consortium as a proposed standard. the standards process typically includes public review (outside the consortium) and a demonstration of proof of concept. your involvement in the public review process or as a member or affiliate of the consortium is welcomed. write to: bob scheifler, mit x consortium, laboratory for computer science, 545 technology square, cambridge, ma 02139. [for complete information see the xconsortium man page from the x11r4 distribution, from which this information is adapted.] [2/90] ---------------------------------------------------------------------- subject: 12) just what are open look and motif? open look and motif are two graphical user interfaces (guis). open look was developed by sun with help from at&t and many industry reviewers; motif was developed by the open software foundation (osf) with input from many osf members. open look is primarily a user-interface specification and style-guide; there are several toolkits which can be used to produce open look applications. motif includes an api specification; the only sanctioned motif toolkit is the one from osf. however, there are other toolkits which can be used to produce programs which look and behave like osf/motif; one of these, parcplace's (formerly solbourne's) oi, is a \"virtual toolkit\" which provides objects in the style of open look and motif, at the user's choice. open look gui is also the name of a product from at&t, comprising their open look intrinsics toolkit and a variety of applications. [thanks to ian darwin, ian@sq.com, 5/91] ---------------------------------------------------------------------- subject: 13) just what is openwindows? open windows (3.0) is a sun product that encompasses: a window system that combines a news and x11-compliant server (x/news); a user-interface specification (open look) and a series of toolkits that implement it (including the sunview-like xview and the xt-based olit); xlib and xt implementations; and a number of utilities (olwm window manager, filemgr, shelltool, etc.). [thanks to frank greco (fgreco@govt.shearson.com), 8/90; 4/92] ---------------------------------------------------------------------- subject: 14) just what is decwindows? decwindows is a dec product that encompasses: an x11 server; the xui toolkit, including the dwt widget set and uil; xlib and xt implementations; a session manager; and a number of utilities (dxwm window manager, dxcalendar, dxpsview, etc.). (at some point motif flavors of the toolkit and applications will be shipped.) [8/90] ---------------------------------------------------------------------- subject: 15) what is pex? pex is the \"phigs extension to x\". phigs stands for \"programmer's hierarchical interactive graphics system\" and is essentially a library of functions that simplifies the creation and manipulation of 3d graphics. many platforms are capable of performing in hardware the computations involved in rendering 3d objects; the extension allows the client (phigs in this case) to take advantage of the specialized hardware for 3d graphics. sun microsystems is currently contracted to develop a freely redistributable (copyright similar to the current x copyright) sample implementation. source and documentation are available in the r5 release. several vendors are currently selling independently-developed pex servers for their workstations and x terminals. [last modified 10/91] ---------------------------------------------------------------------- subject: 16) what is \"low-bandwidth x\" (lbx)? xremote? ppp? slip? cslip? there are several options for using x over serial lines: slip - serial line ip; this is both a mechanism and a protocol for sending ip packets over point-to-point serial links. it has been around for several years, and implementations are available for many of the major tcp/ip implementations. most x terminal vendors supply this as a checkoff item, although nobody really ever uses it since it is horribly slow. the tcp/ip headers add 40 bytes per packet and the tcp/ip encoding of the x protocol is rather verbose (rightfully so; it is optimized for packing and unpacking over high-speed links). cslip - compressed header slip; this is a variant of slip that compresses the 40 bytes of tcp/ip headers down to about 5 or 6 bytes. it still doesn't do anything about reencoding the x protocol. modems that do compression can help, but they increase packet latency (it takes time to dribble the uncompressed data through typical serial interfaces, plus the compression assembly time). ppp - point-to-point protocol; this is an emerging standard for point-to-point links over serial lines that has a more complete set of option negotiation than slip. a growing number of people see the combination of ppp for the serial line management and cslip for the header compression as becoming common for running normal tcp/ip protocols over serial lines. running raw x over the wire still needs compression somewhere to make it usable. xremote - this is the name of both a protocol and set of products originally developed by ncd for squeezing the x protocol over serial lines. in addition to using a low level transport mechanism similar to ppp/cslip, xremote removes redundancies in the x protocol by sending deltas against previous packets and using lzw to compress the entire data stream. this work is done by either a pseudo-x server or \"proxy\" running on the host or in a terminal server. there are several advantages to doing compression outside the modem: (1) you don't *have* to have compressing modems in there if you wouldn't otherwise be using them (e.g. if you were going to be directly connected), and (2) it reduces the i/o overhead by cutting down on the number of bytes that have to cross the serial interface, and (3) in addition to the effects of #2, it reduces the latency in delivering packets by not requiring the modem to buffer up the data waiting for blocks to compress. lbx - low bandwidth x; this is an x consortium project that is working on a standard for this area. it is being chaired by ncd and xerox and is using ncd's xremote protocol as a stepping stone in developing the new protocol. lbx will go beyond xremote by adding proxy caching of commonly-used information (e.g. connection setup data, large window properties, font metrics, keymaps, etc.) and a more efficient encoding of the x protocol. the hope is to have a standard ready for public review in the first half of next year and a sample implementation available in r6. additional technical information about how xremote works and a few notes on how lbx might be different are available via anonymous ftp from export.lcs.mit.edu in contrib/ in the following files: xremote-slides.ps slides describing xremote xremote-lbx-diffs.ps more slides describing some of lbx [information provided by jim fulton, jim@ncd.com; 7/92] there is also a set of slides on export from jim fulton's talk at the 7th mit x technical conference. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- subject: 17) topic: using x in day-to-day life ---------------------------------------------------------------------- subject: 18)! what are all these different window managers? the window manager in x is just another client -- it is not part of the x window system, although it enjoys special privileges -- and so there is no single window manager; instead, there are many which support different ways for the user to interact with windows and different styles of window layout, decoration, and keyboard and colormap focus. in approximate chronological order (generally, the more recent ones are more conformant with the icccm): wm: this simple title-bar window manager was phased out in r2 or r3 uwm: the universal window manager is still popular for its speed, although it is very outdated. moved to contrib/ on the r4 tape. twm (old): tom's window manager was among the first non-mit window managers and offered the user a great deal of customization options in a re-parenting window manager. awm: the ardent window manager remains a hotbed for hackers and offers some features (dynamic menus) not found on more current window managers cwm: cwm is part of the andrew system. rtl: siemen's window manager tiles windows so that they don't overlap and resizes the window with the focus to its preferred size. dxwm: digital's dxwm is part of the decwindows offering hpwm: hp's window manager offers a 3d look; it is a precursor of mwm mwm: the motif window manager is part of the osf/motif toolkit tekwm: tektronix's window manager offering olwm (sun): olwm implements the open look gui and some of the style guide functionality olwm (at&t): ditto gwm: bull's generic window manager emulates others with a built-in lisp interpreter. version 1.7h (10/91) is on the r5 contrib tape; 1.7n is on avahi.inria.fr and export.lcs.mit.edu. [3/93] m_swm: the sigma window manager is on the r4 tape pswm: sun's postscript-based pswm is part of the openwindows release swm: solbourne's swm is based on the oi toolkit and offers multiple gui support and also a panned virtual window; configuration information comes from the resources file twm (new): mit's new tab window manager from the r4 tape is a reworked twm and is the basis for several derivatives, including the one on the r5 tape vtwm: vtwm offers some of the virtual-desktop features of swm, with a single-root window implementation; it is based on the r4 twm and is available on archive servers. a new version, vtwm-5.0, is based on r5.9 and is available from export. [3/92] tvtwm: tom's virtual tab window manager is also based on the r4 twm and provides a virtual desktop modeled on the virtual-root window of swm. it is available on archive servers olvwm: the vtwm-style virtual-desktop added to sun's olwm. it is available on archive servers; version 3.3 [1/93] is on export. mvwm: the vtwm-style virtual-desktop added to osf's mwm. a beta version is floating around (most recently from suresh@unipalm.co.uk) but requires a source license to osf/motif 1.1.3 [3/92]. ncdwm: the window manager local to ncd terminals offers an mwm look xdswm: the window manager local to visual technology's terminals ctwm: claude lecommandeur's (lecom@sic.epfl.ch) modification of the r5 twm offers 32 virtual screens in the fashion of hp vuewm; source is on export. version 2.2.2 [2/93] also offers the window overview used in vtwm and tvtwm. vuewm: hp's mwm-based window manager offers configurable workspaces. 4dwm: sgi's enhanced mwm piewm: this version of tvtwm offers pie menus ---------------------------------------------------------------------- subject: 19) why does my x session exit when i kill my window manager (sic)? it needn't. what is probably happening is that you are running your window manager as the last job in your .xsession or .xinitrc file; your x session runs only as long as the last job is running, and so killing your window manager is equivalent to logging out. instead, run the window manager in the background, and as the last job instead invoke something safe like: exec xterm -name login -rv -iconic or any special client of your devising which exits on some user action. your x session will continue until you explicitly logout of this window, whether or not you kill or restart your window manager. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- subject: 20) can i save the state of my x session, like toolplaces does? although no known window manager directly supports such a feature -- which may be equivalent to writing out a .xinitrc or .xsession file naming the geometry and wm_command of each application (but olvwm may have something close) -- there is a contributed application which does much of what you are looking for, although it is not as complete as the sunview program toolplaces. look for the application \"xplaces\" on an archive-server near you. there are several versions of this program floating around; look for a recent vintage. [10/90] some new pseudo session-managers such as hp's vuewm provide for the saving of sessions including information on the geometry of currently-running applications and the resource database. [bjxrn stabell (bjoerns@staff.cs.uit.no); 3/93.] ---------------------------------------------------------------------- subject: 21) how do i use another window manager with dec's session manager? dec's session manager will start dxwm up by default. to override this, add to your .xdefaults file something like this line, naming the full pathname: sm.windowmanagername: /wherever/usr/bin/x11/your_favorite_wm ---------------------------------------------------------------------- subject: 22) how do i change the keyboard auto-repeat rate? you can turn auto-repeat on or off by using \"xset r on|off\". the x protocol, however, doesn't provide for varying the auto-repeat rate, which is a capability not supported by all systems. some servers running on systems that support this, however, may provide command-line flags to set the rate at start-up time. if you have control over server start-up (see the man pages for xinit and xdm), you can invoke the server with the chosen settings; for example, you can start the xsun server from mit with the options \"-ar1 350 -ar2 30\" to reduce the sensitivity of the keyboard. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- subject: 23) how do i remap the keys on my keyboard to produce a string? there is no method of arranging for a particular string to be produced when you press a particular key. the xmodmap client, which is useful for moving your ctrl and esc keys to useful places, just rearranges keys and does not do \"macro expansion.\" some (few) clients, including xterm and several x-based editors, accept a translation resource such as: xterm*vt100.translations: #override \\ <key>f1: string(\"setenv display unix:0\") which permits the shorthand f1 to be pressed to reset the display locally within an xterm; it takes effect for new xterm clients. to include control characters in the string, use \\nnn, where nnn is the octal encoding of the control character you want to include. window managers, which could provide this facility, do not yet; nor has a special \"remapper\" client been made available. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- david b. lewis faq%craft@uunet.uu.net \"just the faqs, ma'am.\" -- joe friday",

            "a good vocoder like ours will give you 8000 bits per second locked at full rate (it's a variable rate voice activity vocoder). if you want less quality, cut that to 4000 bps (half rate). at full rate variable you could put two full-duplex conversations on a v.32bis modem. this requires a dsp or asics, though. an rs-6000 has a cpu that could probably do it in real-time, because it has the add-and-multiply instruction and a few other dsp things. if you want to do speech in real-time you need about 4000 samples a second (for not very good voice) with your 8 bit samples (isdn is 8000 8-bit samples a second), which is 32 kbps. you could do a fast 2:1 compression on that to get it down to 16 kbps, which is just about v.32bis. the quality at this point is very bleah, but it should work. now add in the time for your encryption method. you're going to need sampling hardware, which is no problem on a new mac, an amiga. or a pc with a soundblaster card (just because they're so popular and cheap - you could also build a simple adc). the problem with the soundblaster is that it doesn't seem to be full duplex - you can't sample and play backq at the same time, making a two-way conversation a bit tough. the special hardware or a more capable sound card may be required. the only thing that worries me is that 2:1 compression - the soundblaster can do it automatically in hardware, but other than that i don't have a good feel for how processor intensive it is, so i can't estimate how fast a pc you'd need.",

            "the dodgers have been shopping harris to other teams in their quest for more left-handed pitching. so far, no takers. personally, i think harris is a defensive liability, and he has also led the team in past years for hitting into double plays, or at least been among the leaders. sharperson showed last year that if given a chance to play every day, he can get the job done. if sharpy played just one base every day, say third, he'd also improve defensively. wallach has helped tremendously on defense, as has reed. the improved defense is quite noticeable and is having an effect on the pitching staff. both astacio and martinez were bailed out in recent starts by great defensive plays. martinez pitched into the ninth in a game that might have seen him lifted in the third in past years. astacio lasted 7 innings the other day under similar circumstances. the dodgers are turning double plays, and keeping more balls in the infield than last year. and piazza has also been great on defense. he has thrown out 10 of 14 batters trying to steal and has at least one pick off at first. wallach, clearly, has contributed to the over all improvement on defense. but his offense is awful and he has cost the dodgers some runs. but i don't think he is as bad as his current average. i suspect he will come out of this slump much as davis and straw seem to have come out of theirs.",

            "all children are born pure, i.e., without sin. however, most saints would view a pregnancy outside of marriage as an occasion of mourning. (some church members would be much more judgmental, but that is *their* problem.) in situations where welfare assistance is provided through our church, bishops usually require that the family be making some effort to live the gospel standards and provide for themselves. however, there are occasions when assistance is provided because of the children in the home. as a former bishop of mine said, \"children are always worthy before god.\" i am not sure what you mean by the term \"bastards\" in this context. latter-day saints believe that through the temple ordinances the family unit may be preserved in eternity. if you use genealogical material or software produced by the church, you may notice a section for \"temple ordinances.\" within that section there should be a spot for signifying \"bic\" which stands for \"born in the covenant.\" the children born to couple sealed (married) within the temple are \"born in the covenant\" and are eligible to be part of that eternal family unit. children born to other couples (whether in a civil marriage or not) would have to be sealed to their parents after their marriage is solemnized for eternity. supposing a child were born to a woman out of wedlock, he or she could be sealed to his or her parents at a later date or adopted into any eternal family unit (which may include one of the birth parents). i can't say if this principle of adoption was revealed at the same time as the sealing ordinances, but it has been accepted for the ~15 years i have been in the church. i would tend to discount any admonitions from the church authorities against having children out of wedlock because even though there are provisions within the lord's plan to recover what we have done wrong the church does not want to give anyone the impression we can sin and repent at our leisure.",

            "there were some recent developments in the dispute about masonry among southern baptists. i posted a summary over in bit.listserv.christia, and i suppose that it might be useful here. note that i do not necessarily agree or disagree with any of what follows: i present it as information. * for a short summary: a southern baptist named larry holly wrote a book claiming that freemasonry is a religion incompatible with christianity. (mr holly's father rejects christianity, and mr holly blames that on the masons.) the sbc's home missions board includes an interfaith witness department, which studies other religions and how to teach them about christ. a few years ago, they were ordered to produce a report on masonry: they concluded that it was not a religion, and therefore was outside their speciality. however, mr holly led a movement of people who oppose masonry, and last year the convention again ordered the hmb to study masonry. (i got the feeling that they were saying \"you got the wrong answer last time, try to do better and get the answer we want.\") anyway, there's been a bit of infighting and some inappropriate actions, but the dust has settled and the report is in. nobody is entirely happy with it, but everybody seems willing to live with it. both sides are saying things such as: \"this was the best we were going to get in the current environment.\" the report commends the masons for the charity work they do, such as the hospitals and burn centers they operate, as well as efforts to help the elderly and prevent drug abuse. the report acknowledges that many well- known christians are and have been masons, and notes that many teachings of masonry are \"supportive of christian faith and practice\". examples of the latter include belief in god, emphases on honesty and integrity, and that some masonic lodges incorporate explicit christian beliefs. on the other hand, they note that some aspects of masonry are incompatible with southern baptist principles. these included the use of titles which some people consider sacrilegious, the taking of certain oaths (even though they are not meant seriously), the \"undeniably pagan and/or occultic\" writings of some masonic leaders, the implication in some masonic writings that salvation can be achieved by good works, and the racial discrimination practiced by many masonic lodges. (i note with some chagrin that baptist churches as a whole aren't really in a place to speak on this last point.) the report concludes that masonry is not a religion, and says that membership should not be endorsed or censured, but left to the discretion of individuals. this was in part because there is variation among different masonic lodges, and while one may include elements strongly against christianity, another may not. many southern baptists have strong convictions about the priesthood of the believer and the autonomy of the local church, and this history probably influenced how the report came out. * the information above was gleaned from \"the religious herald\", a publication of the baptist general association of virginia, and \"baptists today\", which does not have any direct links to a religious organisation.

(unfortunately, one site was doing more work, and didn't have the cpu for it, so it didn't sound all that good at a different site) so, you don't neccessarily have to have a clear-text bridge. but if you do, its totally internal to one of the sites involved in the conversation.... -derek",

            "there has been quite a bit of discussion about house wiring and grounding practices here. a few points need to be clarified: the equipment grounding conductor, green, green with a yellow stripe, bare, or the metal sheath or pipe of some wiring methods, is used as a safety ground, to carry fault currents back to the circuit breaker panel, and to limit the voltage on the metal case of utilization equipment or other metal objects. it should never (except for a few exceptions to be discussed later) carry the normal operating current of a connected load. some equipment has filters in the power supply which may cause some slight current flow through the grounding conductor. much communications or audio equipment is sensitive to noise or slight voltages on the grounding conductor, and may require special wiring of the grounding conductors to provide reliable operation (\"orange\" outlets are often used for this, with insulated grounding conductors wired back to the panel box, and in many cases back to the service. anyone installing such a system should read both the section on grounding in the national electric code and publications on installing quiet isolated ground systems. the code requires the insulated grounding conductors (green wires) to run with the current carrying conductors back to the panel box, and, if required, back all the way to the service entrance , where it is bonded to the service ground (water pipe or rod) many of these systems are installed illegally or unsafely, where they do not provide a safe ground or a quiet ground or either. the grounded conductor of a circuit, often called the neutral, which is referred to in the code as the \"identified\" conductor and is supposed to be white or natural grey. this conductor is supposed to be connected to ground in most electrical systems at a single point, generally at the service entrance panel. this connection is through the main bonding jumper. (in many household service panels, the main bonding jumper is actually a bonding screw which attaches the neutral busbar to the case of the panel) the grounded conductor (neutral) is generally a current carrying conductor. in the case of a 120 volt circuit it is one of the two conductors completing the circuit from the panel to the load device. since the grounded conductor (neutral) is only connected to the grounding conductor (bare or green) at the service entrance, if the load is any distance from the service and draws any significant current, there will be a small but measurable voltage between the grounded and grounding conductors at the load, under normal operating conditions. if you should (incorrectly) connect the grounded (neutral) conductor to the grounding conductor at the load, some of the neutral current will flow instead through the grounding conductor. since there will now be current flowing through the grounding conductor, it will also no longer be quite at ground potential at the load end. if the load equipment has a metal case, which is connected to the grounding conductor through the \"u\" ground plug, the metal case is now also no longer quite at ground potential. the difference (under normal, non short-circuit conditions) may be only a few tenths of a volt, but it could also be a volt or two. this normally does not present a shock hazard. however, if you let the metal case of the grounded equipment come into contact with an independently grounded object such as a water or gas pipe, a radiator, a metal air conditioning duct or such, part of the neutral current will try to flow through this aalternate ground path. if the contact is not solid, you will get a significant arc (a low voltage, but possibly moderate current arc) under the wrong conditions, this arcing could start a fire. it is possible in some cases that the sneak ground current could also flow through a wire of inadequate size, causing it to overheat. with the incorrect non single-point grounding of the neutral, if there is a short circuit from hot to neutral, the high short circuit current which may flow will cause a much higher voltage on the grounding conductor, which increases the possibility for shock or fire. also if you incorrectly multiply connect the neutral and ground, the voltage on the ground system is seen as noise bu computer or audio equipment, often causing malfunction. i have spent some hours tracking down such shorts in technical facilities where they were inducing severe hum into equipment. the neutral is usually bonded to the ground at the distribution transformer as well as at the service entrance of each dwelling. this is done primarily for lightning protection, so that induced lightning currents have a short path back to ground, and also to assure that the currents drawn by shorts to grounded objects like pipes draw enough current to trip circuit breakers or blow fuses quickly. the bad side of this is that not all the neutral current from the dwelling goes through the neutral wire back to the transformer. some of it flows through the grounding electrode (water pipe, etc.) this may cause corrosion in the pipes and possibly in things like underground fuel oil tanks, and it may also cause measurable ac magnetic fields due to the large loop between the \"hot\" conductors in the service and the neutral current in the water pipe and ground. there are those who feel these fields may be unhealthy. (don't flame me on this, i'm just telling you where the field comes from, not it's health effect, as far as i'm concerned, the jury is still out on this.) note that the bonding jumper is only installed at the main panel, not at any sub distribution panels. this is one reason why it is illegal to run service entrance cable with the sheath used as a neutral to a sub panel, you must have a seperate insulated conductor for the neutral. the sheath can be used in this application only as the grounding conductor. if the neutral is bonded to the grounding conductor in the sub panel, say by forgetting to remove the bonding screw, all the grounding conductors of the loads on that panel will be above ground, with the possible problems listed above. the code makes exceptions for ranges and dryers, as well as feeds from one building to another. in the cases of the range and dryer, the neutral may be used as the equipment ground under certain conditions, instead of a seperate wire. every time the code is revised, these exceptions come up for review. these exceptions were, in fact the first required safety grounds, in the days before u ground outlets and such. the appliance manufacturers don't want to have to redesign their ranges and driers, and the contractors don't want to have to run four wire cable (with four fairly heavy, expensive wires) in place of three wire to the appliances. no question it would be safer with seperate neutrals to the stove, but the neutral current is low for most burner settings (since most current is in the 220 volt \"hots\" except at some low settings, the wires are large gauge, and there are few reported cases of injury or damage. so far, the exceptions have survived. in the case of feeds between buildings, it's primarily for lightning protection. people doing wiring should be aware what is and what isn't a legal grounding conductor. obviously, the bare wire in \"romex\" 'with ground' is. anywhere there is a green wire installed, such as in a portable cord, that is a good grounding conductor. the sheath of bx clamped in bx connectors in metal boxes is a legal grounding conductor (in the us). (bx has an aluminum band run under the steel sheath to lower the resistance of the sheath. you can just cut this aluminum band off at the ends, you don't have to bond it to anything, it does its job by touching every turn of the bx sheath.) conduit or emt (thinwall tubing) is generally a legal grounding conductor, but may require a bonding locknut where it enters a box or panel, particularly for larger pipes. \"greenfield\" (looks like big bx, but you pull your own wires in the empty sheath after you run it) is not a legal grounding conductor, as it doesn't have the aluminum band to bond it, and the spiral steel has too much resistance and inductance. you have to run a seperate green grounding conductor inside the greenfield. \"wiremold\" is also not a legal grounding conductor, as the paint on the boxes often prevents good contact, and the \"feed\" to the wiremold extension is often from a box in the wall that may not be well connected to the first wiremold box. i have personally discovered cases where the entire run of wiremold and the cases of everything plugged into all the outlets on the run were \"hot\" with 120 volts (why do i get a shock every time i touch my computer and the radiator here in the office?) because there was no ground wire in the wiremold and one of the outlets had shorted to the edge of the wiremold box. you must run a ground wire back in the wiremold from the outlets at least to the first box in the original wiring (conduit, bx, etc.) where you can \"bond\" the wire to the box with a screw, bnding clip, or whatever. on another issue, while you should ground the green wire/lug on gcfi outlets when ever there is a place to ground them, it is legal in the nec to use them without a ground if no ground is available. it is better to have the protection of the ground fault interrupter than no protection if you don't install it. the interrupter doesn't depend on the ground to trip. it is desirable to connect the ground if available, because if the ground is connected, the interrupter will trip as soon as a faulty device is plugged in, whereas without the ground, it will not trip until someone or something provides a ground path. for those questioning the legal use of ungrounded gcfi's, read in the nec, 210-7 (d) exception. (this is the 1990 code, my '93 code is in the city, but i know the rule hasn't changed. it might be renumbered though.) we have only touched the surface concerning grounding ;-} , there is much more to this subject, but most of you have fallen asleep by now. john",

            "archive-name: ripem/attacks last-update: 31 mar 93 21:00:00 -0500 some possible attacks on ripem ------------------------------ this is a living list of potential weaknesses to keep your eyes open for when using ripem for secure electronic mail. it does not go into great detail, and is almost certainly not exhaustive. obviously, many of the weaknesses are weaknesses of cryptographically secured mail in general, and will pertain to secure mail programs other than ripem. it is maintained by marc vanheyningen <mvanheyn@cs.indiana.edu>. it is posted monthly to a variety of news groups; followups pertaining specifically to ripem should go to alt.security.ripem. cryptanalysis attacks --------------------- - breaking rsa would allow an attacker to find out your private key, in which case he could read any mail encrypted to you and sign messages with your private key. rsa is generally believed to be resistant to all standard cryptanalytic techniques. even a standard key (about 516 bits with ripem) is long enough to render this impractical, barring a huge investment in hardware or a breakthrough in factoring. - breaking des would allow an attacker to read any given message, since the message itself is encrypted with des. it would not allow an attacker to claim to be you. des has only 56 bits in its key, and thus could conceivably be compromised by brute force with sufficient hardware, but few agencies have such money to devote to simply read one message. since each message has a different des key, the work for each message would remain high. key management attacks ---------------------- - stealing your private key would allow the same benefits as breaking rsa. to safeguard it, it is encrypted with a des key which is derived from a passphrase you type in. however, if an attacker can get a copy of your private keyfile and your passphrase (by snooping network packets, tapping lines, or whatever) he could break the whole scheme. the main risk is that of transferring either the passphrase or the private key file across an untrusted link. so don't do that. run ripem on a trusted machine, preferably one sitting right in front of you. ideally, your own machine in your own home (or maybe office) which nobody else has physical access to. - fooling you into accepting a bogus public key for someone else could allow an opponent to deceive you into sending secret messages to him rather than to the real recipient. if the enemy can fool your intended recipient as well, he could re-encrypt the messages with the other bogus public key and pass them along. it is important to get the proper public keys of other people. the most common mechanism for this is finger; assuming the opponent has not compromised routers or daemons or such, finger can be given a fair amount of trust. the strongest method of key authentication is to exchange keys in person; however, this is not always practical. having other people \"vouch for you\" by signing a statement containing your key is possible, although ripem doesn't have features for doing this as automatically as pgp. ripem does generate and check md5 fingerprints of public keys in the key files; they may be exchanged via a separate channel for authentication. playback attacks ---------------- - even if an opponent cannot break the cryptography, an opponent could still cause difficulties. for example, suppose you send a message with mic-only (a pem mode which does not provide disclosure protection) to alice which says \"ok, let's do that.\" your opponent intercepts it, and now resends it to bob, who now has a message which is authenticated as from you telling him to do that. of course, he may interpret it in an entirely different context. or your opponent could transmit the same message to the same recipient much later, figuring it would be seen differently at a later time. or the opponent could change the originator-name: to himself, register your public key as his, and send a message hoping the recipient will send him return mail indicating (perhaps even quoting!) the unknown message. to defeat playback attacks, the plaintext of each message should include some indication of the sender and recipient, and a unique identifier (typically the date). a good front-end script for ripem should do this automatically (imho). as a recipient, you should be sure that the originator-name: header and the sender indicated within the plaintext are the same, that you really are a recipient, and that the message is not an old one. some this also can and should be automated. the author of this faq has made a modest attempt at automating the process of generating and checking encapsulated headers; the programs are included in the standard distribution in the utils directory. local attacks ------------- - clearly, the security of ripem cannot be greater than the security of the machine where the encryption is performed. for example, under unix, a super-user could manage to get at your encrypted mail, although it would take some planning and effort to do something like replace the ripem executable with a trojan horse or to get a copy of the plaintext, depending how it's stored. in addition, the link between you and the machine running ripem is an extension of that. if you decrypt with ripem on a remote machine which you are connected to via network (or, worse yet, modem), an eavesdropper could see the plaintext (and probably also your passphrase.) ripem should only be executed on systems you trust, obviously. in the extreme case, ripem should only be used on your own machine, which you have total control over and which nobody else has access to, which has only carefully examined software known to be free of viruses, and so on. however, there's a very real trade-off between convenience and security here. a more moderately cautious user might use ripem on a unix workstation where other people have access (even root access), but increase security by keeping private keys and the (statically linked, of course) executable on a floppy disk. some people will keep ripem on a multi-user system, but when dialing in over an insecure line, they will download the message to their own system and perform the ripem decryption there. however, the security provided by such a mechanism is somewhat illusory; since you presumably type your cleartext password to log in, you've just given away the store, since the attacker can now log in as you and install traps in your account to steal your private key next time you use it from a less insecure line. this will likely remain the situation as long as most systems use the rather quaint mechanism of cleartext password authentication. i find it nice to put a brief statement of how carefully i manage my security arrangement in my .plan next to my public key, so that potential correspondents can be aware what level of precautions are in place. some people use two keys, a short one which is not carefully managed for ordinary use and a longer one which is treated with greater care for critical correspondence. untrusted partner attacks ------------------------- - ripem's encryption will ensure that only a person with the private key corresponding to the public key used to encrypt the data may read the traffic. however, once someone with that key gets the message, she may always make whatever kind of transformations she wishes. there exist no cryptographic barriers to a recipient, say, taking an encrypted message and converting it to a mic-only message, signed by you and readable by anyone, although ripem does not provide this functionality. indeed, the latest pem draft i have seen specifically states that such transformations should be possible to allow forwarding functions to work.",

            "srebrenica's doctor recounts town's living hell by laura pitter tuzla, bosnia, reuter - neret mujanovic was a pathologist when he trekked through the mountains to the besieged muslim town of srebrenica last august. but after treating 4,000 mangled victims of bosnia's bloody war, he considers himself a surgeon. ``now i'm a surgeon with great experience although i have no license to practice. but if i operate on a person and he lives normally that's the greatest license a surgeon could have.'' evacuated by the u.n. this week to his home town of tuzla, the muslim physician gave an eyewitness medical assessment of the horrors of the year-long serb siege of srebrenica and the suffering of the thousands trapped there. ``i lived through hell together with the people of srebrenica. all those who lived through this are the greatest heroes that humanity can produce,'' he told reporters. mujanovic, 31, had practiced for two months as an assistant at a local hospital in tuzla, but before going to srebrenica he had never performed a surgical operation on his own. now he says he has performed major surgery 1,396 times, relying on books for guidance, amputating arms and legs 150 times, usually without anesthetic, delivering 350 babies and performing four cesarean sections. he worked 18-to-19-hour days, slept in the hospital for the first 10 weeks after his arrival last aug. 5 and treated 4,000 patients. he arrived after making the trek over mountains on foot from tuzla, 60 miles northwest of srebrenica. about 50 other people carried in supplies and 350 soldiers guided and protected him through guerrilla terrain, he said. his worst memory was of 10 days ago when seven serb shells landed within one minute in an area half the size of a football field, killing 36 people immediately and wounding 102. half of the dead were women and children. the people had come out for a rare day of sunshine and the children were playing soccer. ``there was no warning ... the blood flowed like a river in the street,'' he said. ``there were pieces of women all around and you could not piece them together. one woman holding her two children in her hands was lying with them on the ground dead. they had no heads.'' before mujanovic arrived with his supplies conditions were deplorable, he said. many deaths could have been prevented had the hospital had surgical tools, facilities and medicine. the six general practitioners who had been operating before he arrived had even less surgical experience than he did. ``they didn't know the basic principles for amputating limbs.'' once he arrived the situation improved, he said, but by mid-september he had run out of supplies. ``bandages were washed and boiled five times ... sometimes they were falling apart in my hands,'' he said. doctors had no anesthetic and could not give patients alcohol to numb the pain because it increased bleeding. ``people were completely conscious during amputations and stomach operations,'' he said. blood transfusions were impossible because they had no facilities to test blood types. ``i felt destroyed psychologically,'' mujanovic said. the situation improved after dec. 4, when a convoy arrived from the belgian medical group medecins sans frontieres. but mujanovic said the military predicament worsened in mid-december after bosnian serbs began a major offensive in the region. ``every day we had air strikes and shellings.'' then the hunger set in. between mid-december and mid-march, when u.s. planes began air dropping food, between 20 and 30 people were dying every day from complications associated with malnutrition, he said. ``i know for sure that the air drop operation saved the people from massive death by hunger and starvation,'' he said. according to mujanovic, around 5,000 people died in srebrenica, 1,000 of them children, during a year of siege. mujanovic plans to return to srebrenica in three weeks after visiting his wife, who is ill in tuzla. ``they say i'm a hero,'' he said. ``there were thousands of people standing at the sides of the road, crying and waving when i left. and i cried too.''",

            "i am not so sure of jewish proselytism then, but i would like to relate an account of a recent dinner i had with jews a few months ago. the dinner was instigated by the aunt of the hostess, whom i had met while visiting my wife in galveston last october. the dear old aunt (now deceased) was very proud of her jewish heritage, although not especially devout. her parents were both murdered in nazi concentration camps in austria during wwii because they were jewish. while conversing with her about politics, world affairs and religion, she remarked that it would be a good idea for me to visit her niece on my return to atlanta. within two days of returning to atlanta, her niece called to invite me over for dinner with her husband. i went, not knowing really what to expect, other than stimulating conversation and fellowship. what i got, however, was rather unexpected. the thrust of the evening's discussion was to condemn the reagan-bush policies prohibiting abortion counseling in federally funded family planning clinics, prohibiting the sterilization of minorities on welfare here and in puerto rico, on the ban on fetal tissue research, and against the mexico city policy, \"which denies u.s. foreign aid to programs overseas that promote abortion.\" the crux of their position was to place the blame for the problems of \"overpopulation,\" rampant domestic crime, african starvation, unwed mothers, etc., on christianity, rather on the fall of adam. now, this is not what i had to come to talk about. but every time i tried to bring up the subject of judaism, they would condemn jews for jesus and admonish me against converting to judaism, \"because it involves too much study and effort.\" and i did not even raise the prospect, nor try to convert them to the truth of christ! there was certainly no jewish proselytism going on there. and again, last november i toured a \"traditional\" jewish synagogue and was subjected to a 30-minute harangue against jesus and christianity in general. i realize that these are two isolated incidents, and that the best supervisor i ever had at work is jewish, but from my experience, the modern jew is not known for his proselytism. -- boundary",

            "ddavis@cass.ma02.bull.com (dave davis) ii. the deuterocanonicals are not in the canon because they are not quoted by the nt authors. that is not quite accurate. otherwise we would have the book of enoch in the canon (as dave noted). one can say that the apocrypha are not quoted by christ. iii. the deuterocanonicals are not in the canon because they teach doctrines contrary to the (uncontroverted) parts of the canon. then i answer: these is a logically invalid *a priori*. besides, we are talking about ot texts- which in many parts are superceded by the nt (in the xtian view). would not this same principle exclude _ecclesiastes_? this principle cannot be consistently applied. i have to reject your argument here. the spirit speaks with one voice, and he does not contradict himself. the ultimate test of canonicity is whether the words are inspired by the spirit, i.e., god-breathed. it is a test which is more guided by faith than by reason or logic. the early church decided that the apocrypha did not meet this test--even though some books such as the wisdom of ben sirach have their uses. for example, the lutheran hymn \"now thank we all our god\" quotes a passage from this book. the deutero-canonical books were added much later in the church's history. they do not have the same spiritual quality as the rest of scripture. i do not believe the church that added these books was guided by the spirit in so doing. and that is where this sort of discussion ultimately ends.",

            "except for their size, the cooling towers on nuclear power plants are vertually identical in construction and operation to cooling towers designed and built in the 1890's (a hundred years ago) for coal fired power plants used for lighting and early electric railways. basicly, the cylindrical tower supports a rapid air draft when its air is heated by hot water and/or steam circulating thru a network of pipes that fill about the lower 1/3 of the tower. to assist cooling and the draft, water misters are added that spray cold water over the hot pipes. the cold water evaporates, removing the heat faster than just air flow from the draft would and the resulting water vapor is rapidly carried away by the draft. this produces the clouds frequently seen rising out of these towers. that slight pinch (maybe 2/3 of the way up the tower) is there because it produces a very significant increase in the strength and rate of the air draft produced, compared to a straight cylinder shape. the towers are used to recondense the steam in the sealed steam system of the power plant so that it can be recirculated back to the boiler and used again. the wider the temperature difference across the turbines used in the power plant the more effecient they are and by recondensing the steam in the cooling towers before sending it back to the boilers you maintain a very wide temperature difference (sometimes as high as 1000 degrees or more from first stage \"hot\" turbine to final stage \"cold\" turbine). r. tim coslet",
            "on palm sunday at our parish, we were \"invited\" to take the role of jesus in the passion. i declined to participate. last year at the liturgy meeting i pointed out how we crucify christ by our sins, so therefore it is appropriate that we retain the role of the crowd, but to no avail. as a member of a liturgy committee, i can tell you that the problem is certain people dominating, who want to try out all kinds of innovations. the priests don't seem even to _want_ to make any decisions of their own in many cases. i guess it's easier to \"try something new\" than it is to refuse to allow it. at our parish on holy thursday, instead of the priests washing feet (\"who wants to get around people's feet,\" according to one of our priests) the congregation was \"invited\" to come up and help wash one another's hands. the symbolism of this action distressed me, and again i refused to participate. i thought that if we were to have to come up with rubrics for this liturgical action (i.e. \"body of christ\" -- \"amen\" for receiving communion), that they could be \"i am not responsible for the blood of this man.\" also for part of the eucharistic prayer (\"blessed are you, god of all creation...\") was substituted some text read by a lay couple. the priest certainly should not have given this part of the mass over to others, and i was so disturbed that i declined to receive communion that night (we aren't required to anyway -- i instead offered up prayers for our priests and parish). the quality of the mass has not changed. again, if it were to be celebrated according to the rubrics set down by the church, it would still be \"liturgically\" beautiful. the problem comes about from people trying to be \"creative\" who are not. i think the answer to your question on participation could be that given by father peter stravinskas in answer to the question posed by the title of thomas day's _why catholics can't sing_. \"they don't want to\" because of all this nonsense. by the way, for any non-catholics reading this, the problem does not reflect bad liturgy by the catholic church, but by those who are disobedient to the church in changing it on their own \"authority.\"",

(the reason it slows you down a touch is that for each key you try you need to use a different set of s-boxes, i know it's only a vector, but it sure makes random search a pain). several marijuana legalization groups have had their mailing lists confiscated when people were charged with drug use/sales. it's not a crime to be a member of a legalization org, *but* you will be watched. it really is important to write a letter to every official you personally vote for to explain *why* your privacy is being destroyed by the \"cripple chip\". amazingly enough they do listen when they get *enough* mail. the doonsbery jokes about nra postcards are real, and the imi (illinois marijuana initiative) has grown to the point where we *are* seeing some changes. it's pretty clear that all the hullabaloo is really about the implimentation decision being made behind our backs. as vesselin points out, this was common practice in communist regimes (and may be again depending on how the vote goes). but just as criminals have guns and \"law abiding\" citizens don't, and criminals like me have marijuana and \"law abiding\" subjects don't, criminals like me will have secure crypto while \"law abiding\" robots don't. pgp is nice, but as time goes on we all can do better. and to save our hides we will. someone posted an excerpt from machiavelli. he's my favorite dude. 500 years ago he saw clearly how people *are*, and tried to explain that to \"princes\" who wanted people to *obey*. one section not quoted (i've got \"the prince\" at home, so i'll just paraphrase :) ) had to do with conquring a free city. the only way is to *completly destroy* it. failing that, you must appoint locals to high positions and accept the people's customs. even after 100 years of oppression, a people will remember their heratige and rise up to overthrow the oppresive government. and he gave an example. and that was 300 years *before* thomas jefferson. there were questions about watching traffic. only *interesting* traffic is watched: stuff that goes overseas and comes back; stuff with keywords like marijauana, cryptography, nsa; certain individuals who are known subversives, etc. it is easy enough to store all that traffic. so if you know how to be *subversive* i.e. how to be unseen, it's pretty easy to go unnoticed for a long time. the stronger your crypto system and the less you're noticed, the better your chances of developing an organization which can diseminate truth to the masses. which gets me to the thread about a \"public encrypted conference\". that's just silly. the first thing the feds do is send in an infiltrator (like dave s.) and they know what you're doing. it will be fun for teenagers and college students, but for the real world it's pretty pointless. crypto is useful for more things than hiding where you get your marijuana. guns, drugs and crypto do have some commonality: there are people in government who want you to *obey* their rules. as lundquist says in alt.drugs \"live free or don't\". machiavelli pointed out that's just how most people actually live, inspite of appearences to the contrary. it's true that the decision to shove the clipper (not the same thing as intergraph's!!!) down our throats violates the principles of what the u.s. was founded on, but the government is full of idiotic robots called bureaucrats and there's less to worry about than one might think. only really innocent (read naive) subjects of the u.s. will be hurt by this, the rest of us *criminals* will live in secure freedom. de toqueville pointed out 150+ years ago that the tyranny of the majority will be mitigated by the mediocrity of the government. and given what i see government officials doing where i work (argonne national lab.) the level of stupidity makes dave s. look smart. patience, persistence, truth, work: dvader@hemp-imi.hep.anl.gov dr. mike home: mrosing@igc.org -----begin pgp signature----- version: 2.2",

            "okay... i argued this thoroughly about 3-4 weeks ago. men and women are different ... physically, physiologically, and psychologically. much recent evidence for this statement is present in the book \"brainsex\" by anne moir and david jessel. i recommend you find a copy and read it. their book is an overview of recent scientific research on this topic and is well referenced. now, if women and men are different in some ways, the law can only adequately take into account their needs in these areas where they are different by also taking into account the ways in which men and women are different. maternity leave is an example of this -- it takes into account that women get pregnant. it does not give women the same rules it would give to men, because to treat women like it treats men in this instance would be unjust. this is just simply an obvious example of where men and women are intrinsically different!!!!! now, people make the _naive_ argument that sexism = oppression. however, maternity leave is sexist because men do not get pregnant. men do not have the same access to leave that women do (not to the same extent or degree), and therefore it is sexist. no matter however much a man _wants_ to get pregnant and have maternity leave, he never can. and therefore the law is sexist. no man can have access to maternity leave, no matter how hard he tries to get pregnant. i hope this is clear. maternity leave is an example where a sexist law is just, because the sexism here just reflects the \"sexism\" of nature in making men and women different. there are many other differences between men and women which are far more subtle than pregnancy, and to find out more of these i recommend you have a look at the book \"brainsex\". your point that perhaps some day men can also be pregnant is fallacious. if men can one day become pregnant it will be by having biologically become women! to have a womb and the other factors required for pregnancy is usually wrapped up in the definition of what a woman is -- so your argument, when it is examined, is seen to be fallacious. you are saying that men can have the sexist maternity leave privilege that women can have if they also become women -- which actually just supports my statement that maternity leave is sexist. there is no official priesthood in islam -- much of this function is taken by islamic scholars. there are female islamic scholars and female islamic scholars have always existed in islam. an example from early islamic history is the prophet's widow, aisha, who was recognized in her time and is recognized in our time as an islamic scholar. you have no evidence for your blanket statement about all religions, and i dispute it. i could go on and on about women in islam, etc., but i recently reposted something here under the heading \"islam and women\" -- if it is still at your news-site i suggest you read it. it is reposted from soc.religion.islam, so if it has disappeared from alt.atheism it still might be in soc.religion.islam (i forgot what its original title was though). i will email it to you if you like. your statement that \"other religions are no different\" is, i think, a statement based simply on lack of knowledge about religions other than christianity and perhaps judaism. aisha, who i mentioned earlier, was not only an islamic scholar but also was, at one stage, a military leader. the prophet's first wife, who died just before the \"hijra\" (the prophet's journey from mecca to medina) was a successful businesswoman. lucio, you cannot make a strong case for your viewpoint when your viewpoint is based on ignorance about world religions.",

            "while i don't read normally read this group, i was looking for valentine radar information (sigh, maybe in the faq) and came across your posting.. i bought a '93 probe gt with the pep 263a last july (now at 9500 miles) after debating over the sentra se-r/nx2000, mx6, mr-2, stealth, prelude, and celica. check this month's consumer reports for previous probe records. my criteria: a \"fun\" car with abs, airbag, over 130hp, and less than $25k. i thought about a turbo, but checking with insurance people ruled that out. the tri-star cars (eclipse/talon/etc) were out since they don't have an air bag. ditto for the mustang(also no abs). the se-r/nx2000/m20 fell into the pocket-rocket category. a good used car buy. the mx-6 was almost there but rolled more than i liked. i didn't like the prelude dash/instrumentation at all. too weird for me. the mr2 has a much smaller non-passenger space than i needed, so out that went. the celica was \"ok\" but underpowered when loaded with options (and somewhat overpriced too) in non-turbo form. i never considered the 240sx since it didn't have an airbag. i did look at it for its rwd virtues but that's it. the corolla never entered my mind. i should have looked at the mitsubishi vr4/dodge stealth more. since my list was exhausted, i bought the probe. :-) the car design is different than earlier years, so it's too early to see its reliability so far. for what it's worth, my comments: my dislikes: shutting door with windows up from inside rarely makes good wind seal. headlights have \"stuck\" up a few times (weather?) air conditioning broke ~4000 miles (pressure cycling switch) condensation around rear washer fluid container doesn't drain completely. crammed engine; little hope for do-it-yourselfers (typical) parts somewhat more expensive than normal ford parts underside plastic doesn't like sharp driveways and speedbumps (typical). assembly gripes: tape on radiator, screw fell out of dash, seat seams not stitched properly. hopefully just a fluke. ford only gives 1 key with the car. c'mon ford, spend an extra few pennies! rear hatch has no padding on corners when up. i'm waiting for the day when i bash my head on the corner. horn buttons behind air bag in spokes and not in center (personal preference) tires fling dirt/mud onto side of car my likes: engine (design/valves/sounds/smoothness/power/mileage/torque) -- definitely #1 handling (very good for fwd; understeer only at limits) transmission (the 5 speed is a must) usable instrumentation (lovely readable analog everywhere) very little torque steer at full power (much better than the '90 sho i drive) stability at 100+mph (high gearing though) low cowl (good visibility in front) heated outside mirrors (nice in fog, never tested in freezing weather) abs/air bag (see above) rear seats fold down (i have few rear seat passengers so a trunk not important) no shake/rattle noises when going over bumps/potholes (still!) tires: 225/55vr16 goodyear eagles (70% left; hoping for 30k :-) as you can see, i'm primarily interested in the engine. while it doesn't have the uummmph of a big-liter car or the turbo rush, the big selling point for me was the all-aluminum 24 value 2.5 liter engine. the overall car is a good buy for the money. that market segment hasn't changed much since july (prelude vtec, honda del sol??). i drive it to and from work each day on relatively smooth roads, and most noticable thing is that the probe's suspension doesn't like potholes. when you test drive one, find a potholed road somewhere around town and see if the jarring you get is tolerable. if you have 3+ passengers, by all means bring them along too. they'll find that they have no room in the back and you'll find that the car rides differently (if that's \"better\" is up to you). also, there's a lot of glass around you which i wasn't expecting; the temperature inside the car gets pretty hot in the summer. my back seat passengers (now very few) complain about the lack of ventilation; you may want to consider that when combined with the heat. i've heard that the exhaust system has trouble, but mine works fine. leather and the keyless entry system weren't available when i got the car so i can't comment on them (i got the car before it was officially announced). i prefer cloth to leather anyway. i wouldn't want this car in the snow: the suspension is too rough for the inevitable surprise potholes, tires aren't meant for snow, and the seats assume that you're not wearing lots of thick clothing. rain is much better: water generally beads off the windshield at freeway speed, the windshield wiper controls are easy and understandable, and i barely hydroplaned once with the eagles (and i was really trying). there is also a definite lack of cup holder/small storage places. the gt has map holders below the speakers in the door, but they're rigid plastic that could fit two cassettes or cd's max. the center console/storage bin/arm rest has *1* cup holder and the back of the front seats have a cloth \"pouch\" but that's it. no change holders. quite a let-down from the sho. and the probe is definitely not a people-mover car or an econo-box car! lastly, don't store wet car covers in the back. the foam will soak the water up and the result will *not* smell pleasant :-(. nathan nathan@sco.com",
            "that is, if the special software is free, like xfree86. there are vendors that sells diamond x drivers for commercial unices. but then, they charge $$$$. i think they only need a signing (i.e. no paying). this still violates the fsf's policy of publically available code. while this is true, there are fixes for those who have already bought diamond cards. in linux, for example, there are utilities that will put the card in vesa mode before invoking x. of course, this means no fine tuning of diamond cards, but at least this will allow those who're stuck with them to use linux+x. i agree with mark's suggestion: if you are buying a video card for specialized free software, avoid diamond. but if you already have one, there may be a fix that can help you. james. -- jjctc@chevron.com | the shortest distance between jtsiao@netcom.com | two puns is a straight line.",

(his nhl debut was the tuesday tie against the isles). like i mentioned before, this guy looked like the best golie on the planet for a while (until he misplayed a mahlakov slap shot to go to ot). i say it's because the isles don't shoot correctly. has anyone else noticed this? also, i think it is really a shame for hockey when i guy like mick vukota gets as much ice time as he does. this guy has about as much hockey talent as jiggs macdonald (who did play hockey, i think). anytime he gets the puck it gets stolen, and he always starts fights and gets needless penalties. richard pilon is another guy who is on the ice to stir up crap. and he's a defenseman. he's got to be approaching negative infinity for his plus/minus. this guy gets beaten all the time. why the need for such \"enforcers\"? not only do fights slow the game down alot, but it takes away from the guys who are really trying to play the game. i'll be one of the few to admit, i do enjoy a good fight once in a while, but only when it's \"called for\". you know, when a guy checks the goalie too hard. in other words, a violation of \"hockey ethics\" might cause you to get puched. but there is no need to start crap when you are losing or becuase you can get away with it!! does anyone agree that referees need to be a little less lenient in the 3rd and ot? i mean come on already. i'm sick of seeing teams pulling guys down, holding guys etc. just becuase the referee doesn't call it. ot and late in the 3rd should be a time for strategy, not physical prowess. trying to set up a goal should be first and foremost. if you are so afraid that the other team is going to score that you have to pull a guy down to prevent it, you don't deserve to win in the first place. just my honest opinion,",
            "well, there were 27 outs in a row with no hits or walks in between, but really, he only retired 26 batters in a row. the first out of the game was the front end of a double play. still counts as a back-end perfect game in my book, though. congrats to chris bosio. too bad the brewers couldn't hold on to him.",

            "i have a 86 chevy sprint with a/c and 4doors. it's odometer turned 90k and the sensor light started blinking. i went to the dealer and he said it was a maintenance light saying i need to change the oxygen sensor. he said, it is to be changed every 30k, but since i bought the car when it had 77k, i don't know if the same thing happened at 30k and 60k. he quoted $198 for the part and $50 to install it. the part cost $30 outside, but the mechanic i went to could not fix it saying the sensor is placed too deep in the engine parts. he suggested i wait till it malfunctions before i do anything. if anyone out there owns a chevy sprint, i want to know how they got their oxygen sensors changed. also, did you face any problem with fixing it without the dealer's help. also, what are the results of the oxygen sensor malfunction. any help would be greatly apprecisted thanks nagesh",
            "that has not been demonstrated. had he come to trial, there was a very real possibility that koresh would have gotten an acquittal on grounds of self- defense. all survivors of the debacle have sworn that the batf shot first. they \"rang the doorbell\" using a concussion grenade! and if the bloody warrants were \"legal\" then why were they _sealed_ after the fight started? and if koresh had declared himself a \"private state\" and was just daring the gov't to go in, then why did he surrender last year to a local sheriff who served a warrant _for_his_arrest_ (as opposed to the batf search warrant, which did not include arrest unless violations were found) by just calling him up to tell him and then going out to collect him with his squad car? that doesn't sound like a dictator to me, it sounds like someone who knows he has a court battle. things might have gone very differently if the batf _had_ \"rung the doorbell\". this is stupid. that is no paranoid assertion, it is testamony from surviving witnesses, and the batf _has_ no tanks, nor am i aware of either the batf _or_ the fbi using any until yesterday. when they use maximum force they do just what they did that first day that got four officers killed. \"underarmed\"? you flabberghast me, they were loaded for bear and every picture shows them wearing bullet-proof vests! they were using concussion grenades and full-auto weapons, what was missing low-yield tac-nukes? this is a transparent attempt to retcon a justification for the ridiculous amount of force used, both initially and yesterday. you should be ashamed. they _had_ a sure-fire method: keep them bottled up and talk them to death or surrender without giving him justification for some looney-tune religious stunt. phil, i've been reading your postings for months and i'm convinced that you will back anything, no matter how damaging it may be to yours or anyone else's rights if you think it will hurt people you don't like. it's people with that attitude that set up the preconditions for the holocaust, a process that is in place _now_ in this country, even if the tattered, pitiful remains of the constitution is slowing its progress. this isn't a libertarian issue, others may argue that line, but from a strictly constitutional view of a democratic gov't, what the fbi and batf did was wrong, wrong, wrong, even if their _reasons_ for trying to arrest koresh were 100% right. _anything_ that leads to the deaths of 17 children, if nothing else touches your stoney heart, is _wrong_ no matter who pushed the button. for god's sake, man, get your morality back. larry smith (smith@ctron.com) no, i don't speak for cabletron. need you ask?",

            "(re: the newsgroup -- followups set to talk.politics.mideast where this belongs.) this may make the term 'civil war' dubious, but it does nothing to the phrase 'destroy the government'. an occupying government is still a govern- ment, and the palestinians have made it quite clear that their goal is not simply to prevent it from occupying the territories that don't con- fer citizenship (which is your own determination of the distinction) but to wipe it out entirely (and, not incidentally, the entire jewish population it rules with it). this is an intent to 'destroy the government', no matter where the government happens to be from. wasn't a requirement for democracy in athens. for that matter, isn't a requirement for the term democracy in the united states, which doesn't let non-citizens vote either. both the united states and israel have processes whereby it is possible to acquire citizenship, with a great deal of effort and a modicum of screening -- it's just that it isn't automatic for living in the territories. it isn't automatic for living in new york, either. that said, suit yourself. having never considered democracy the ultimate in good in this world, i could care less if you feel like calling israel, or america, or anywhere else, a democracy. personally, i withhold the term from israel for the same reason i withhold it from britain... the parliamentary system is a serious handicap. again, suit yourself. in which case israel is *not* attacking its own people, it is fighting a war on foreign soil, in which case the residents are entitled to play rough, yes -- but israel's allowed to get just as rough, within the bare limits of the rules of war. this includes, among other things, the right to shoot or bomb *anyone* a national of the coun- try in question who is fighting them (which permits mass frontal assault on all rock-throwers), along with the right to take out any installation of military importance (certain villages with too-good fortifications can be handled by aerial bombing, as can waterways since they count as supply lines to the enemy), and the right to do anything whatsoever to whatever constitutes a government that they can lay hands on (if hamas is trying to set up as the ruling party, let them beware). if this is not the scenario you want, i recommend you go back to calling it a civil war. civil wars have to be handled nicer. you cannot say the palestinians are a nation fighting a resistance war against a foreign nation and still call israel a government who is treating its own people cruelly. if the palestinians are fighting a war against a foreign country, so is israel, and the gloves come *off*. -naomi",

microdistrict no. 3 sumgait [azerbaijan] on the 27th my sister marina and i went to the movies the seven o'clock show, at the theater that is across from the city party committee, about 50 yards away. the sk theater. they were showing an argentinian film, \"the abyss.\" before the film we noticed about 60 to 70 people standing near the podium at the city party committee, but they were silent, there's no conversation whatsoever, and we couldn't figure out what was going on. that is, we knew it was about karabagh, but what it was exactly, what they were talking about, if someone gave a speech or not, we didn't know. we bought our tickets. there were 30 or 40 people in the theater. this was a very small number for that large movie theater. the film started. about 30 minutes later they stopped the film. a crowd burst in. about 60 people. they came up onto the stage. well mostly they were young people, from 16 to 23 years old. they demanded that an armenian woman come up onto the stage. they used foul language and said that they were going to show what azerbaijanis were capable of, what they could do to armenian girls. i thought that's what they meant because they had demanded a girl specifically. marina and i were sitting together. i told her to move over, there were some russian girls sitting nearby. so that if someone recognized me or if something happened, they would take me, and not marina. it got quiet, 2 or 3 girls jumped up to run out, but the door was closed--it's only opened at the end of the show--and they returned to their seats. everyone in the theater was looking at one another, russians, azerbaijanis, people of various nationalities. but no one reacted at all, no one in the auditorium made a sound. they were silent, looking at one another, and gradually started to leave. some guy, a really fat one, says, \"ok, we've scared them enough, let's leave.\" they leave slowly, pompously. it seemed to me that those people were not themselves. either they had smoked a bunch of \"anasha\", or had taken something else, because they all looked beastly, like they were ready to tear anyone apart. then it was all over, as though nothing had happened at all. the film started up again, it was one of those cheerful films which should have only brought pleasure, made you happy to be alive. we could barely sit to the end. so it had started at seven it was over by nine, and it was dark . . . marina and i were walking home, lenin street, that's the center of town. lenin street was packed, just packed with young people. they were shouting, something about karabagh and something about armenians. we weren't especially listening, because the way we were feeling we didn't know if we were going to make it home or not, and just what had happened anyway? public transportation wasn't running. incidentally, when we came out of the theater we saw police, policemen standing there. the director of the movie theater was looking at the doors, because when they were leaving they had broken the glass, the doors there are basically all glass. everything was broken. he stood there grief- stricken, but looking as though nothing really big had happened, like some naughty boys had just broken them quite by accident, with a slingshot. well, since he looked more or less calm i decided that, nothing all that super serious had happened. we went out very slowly; we wanted to catch a bus, we live literally one stop away. we didn't want to go on foot, not because it was dark, but because something might happen. we flagged down a cab, but the driver didn't want to take us. we told him we live near the bus station, and he said he'd take us to the bus station and not a yard farther. i said, well, ok . . . so we got into the cab and managed to get there. something incredible was happening at the bus station. there was a traffic jam. public transportation was at a standstill and everyone was shouting \"ka-ra-bagh,\" they're not going to give up karabagh. i go home and tell my family what's going on, and there's immediate panic in the house. mamma says, what should we do? like the end had come, they were going to come, kill us, that's it . . . somehow we managed to cheer ourselves up: nothing that bad could happen. where are we living anyway, just what kind of social order do we have? somehow we manage to calm mamma down. and we went to bed. but no one could sleep. everyone made as though nothing had happened. that was on saturday. in short, the day went by. we didn't go anywhere and didn't call our relatives. no one did anything. because . . . life goes on. that day i realized something was approaching, but what exactly, i couldn't guess. on the 28th everything was like it was supposed to be, we lived like we always had. there were five of us at home: mamma, papa and us, three sisters: lyuda, marina, and i. my sister lyuda was in yerevan at the time. we sat at home and no one went out. later we learned that a demonstration had started that morning. it all started . . . they were smashing up stores. we were sitting at home and didn't know anything about it. then a girlfriend of mine, lyuda zimogliad, came by at around three o'clock i think. we worked together, we did our apprenticeships together, she's a russian girl. she said that something awful was happening in town. i asked, \"don't they want armenians? well what are they after, if they're already in that state?\" she says, no, nothing like that, it's just a demonstration, but it's awful to watch it. somehow, it feels like a war has broken out. public transportation has been stopped . . . the cabs, the buses, well it's just a nightmare. then papa decides to go to the drugstore, my mother was having allergy problems at the time . . . he left the house and our neighbor, aunt vera, asked him, \"where are you going? stop! there are such terrible things going on in the courtyard; aren't you afraid to go out?\" papa didn't know what she was talking about. she simply pushed him back into the entryway. he came home and told mamma. mamma said, \"well, if aunt vera was talking like that it means that something is really going on.\" but we didn't go see her, she's a russian, she lives across from us. i had to see my friend out. around five o'clock i tell lyuda, \"ok, look, it's time for you to go, it's late already, i'll see you out.\" mamma says, \"you don't need to go, it's too late already, you can see what the situation in town is.\" so we decided to stay home. dinner was ready. mamma says, \"let her eat with us, then she can go.\" we sat down at the table. but no one was hungry, no one was in the mood, we just put everything out on the table to calm ourselves down, and make it appear that we're eating. we turned on the television, and the show \"in fairy-tale land\" was coming on. we cleared the table. we hear some noise out in the courtyard. i go out on the balcony, but i can't see what's going on, because the noise is coming from the direction of the bus station, and there is a 9-story building in the way. there is mob of people . . . i can't figure out what's happening. they're shouting something, looking somewhere, i can't make out what is going on. i go down to a neighbor, she's an azerbaijani; we've been friends of her family for about 25 years. i go down to look from their place. i see people shouting, looking at the 5-and 9-story buildings near the bus station. just then soldiers set upon them, about 20 people, with clubs. the mob runs off in different directions. i even see several people from our building. they are looking and laughing . . . i decide that means it's not all that bad if they are laughing: it means they're not killing anyone. but now the crowd suddenly dashes toward the soldiers. one of the soldiers cannot manage to get away, they start stomping on him with their feet, everyone's kicking him . . . i become ill and go home, and explain in general terms that horrible things are going on out there . . . can't speak . . . well, they've probably killed that soldier, the way that crowd is . . . if each of them kicked him just once . . . they took his club away from him and started to beat him with it. but it was far away and i couldn't see if he got up and left or not. i become terrified and go home and say, \"lyuda, don't go anywhere, stay at our place, because if you go out they could kill you or . . . \" then the crowd runs over closer toward our building and stands at the 12-story building and starts shouting something. we go out onto the balcony. all of our neighbors are also out on theirs, too. everyone is standing, staring. the mob is shouting and about 5 minutes later comes running toward our building. as it turns out, at the 12-story building the azerbaijani neighbors went down and kept them from coming in. there's only one entryway there, they could stop them. they all run up to our building. mamma immediately starts closing the windows, afraid that they might throw stones. they have stones and they break the windows, all of them. there are very many people. we have a large courtyard, and it's packed with people. they spill up to the first floor so they don't crush each other. they crawl up on trees, posts, and garages. it's just a huge cloud of people. they break and burn the motorcycle of the armenian sergey sargisian, from our building. we close the windows and immediately hear tramping in our entryway. they come up to our fifth floor with a tremendous din and roar. it's incomprehensible. mamma told me later that they were shouting father's name, \"grisha, open the door, we've come to kill you!,\" or something like that. i don't remember that, i was spaced out, kind of. mamma says, \"into the bedroom, quickly!\" in the bedroom we have two tall beds, part of our dowry; mamma says, \"hide there, they probably won't come in there, they'll ask something, say something, and leave.\" she says, \"we'll tell them that we live alone here.\" i can't imagine that my parents will stand out in the hall alone talking with some sort of beasts . . . i go to them and say that i'll stand together with them, i'll talk with them if they come, maybe i can find a common language with them, all the more so if they know me: i speak azerbaijani more or less, and i can find out what they want. i told marina and lyuda to hide under the bed, and my sister lyuda, i can't remember if i told her anything or not. then . . . they open the door: it's like they blew on it and it broke and fell right into the hall. the crows bursts in and starts to shout: get out of here, leave, vacate the apartment and go back to your armenia; things like that. i tell them, \"what has happened, speak calmly. one of you, tell me, calmly, what has happened.\" in azerbaijani, they say, \"get out of the apartment, leave.\" i say, \"ok. go downstairs. we'll gather everything we need and leave the apartment.\" i realize that it is senseless to discuss any sort of rights with them, these are animals. they must be stopped. the ones standing in the doorway, the young guys, say, \"there are old people and one girl with them. too bad!\" they take two or three steps back. it seems as though i have pacified them with our exchange. then someone in the courtyard shouts, commanding them: \"don't you understand what you are saying? kill them?\" and that was it! that was all it took. they grab papa, carry him into one room, and mamma and me into another. they put mamma on the bed and start undressing her, beating her legs. they start tearing my clothes, right there, in front of mamma. i don't remember where they went, what they did, or how much time passed. i had the feeling that they beat me on the head, on my body, and tore my clothes, all at the same time, i don't even know what i said. the atrocities started. i was savagely raped in that room. they argued among themselves who would go first. later, i remember, i came to. i don't know if i'm dead or alive. someone comes in, someone tall, i think, clean-shaven, in an eskimo dogskin coat, balding. he looks around at what's happening. at that instant everything stops. it seems to me that he is either their commander or . . . that somehow everything depends on him. he looks and says, \"well, we're done here.\" they are beating mamma on the head. they break up the chairs and beat her with the chair legs . . . she loses consciousness, and they decide that she's dead. papa . . . was out cold. they want to throw lyuda off the balcony, but they can't get the window open. apparently the window frames are stuck after the rain and the windows can't be opened. they leave her next to the window. she was thinking about being thrown out the window and passed out. she's not a real strong person anyway . . . he looks at me and sees that i'm saying something, that i'm still twitching. well, i start saying the opposite of what i should be, which is humbling myself and pleading. i start shouting, cursing . . . they don't get any entreaty out of me. i already know that i'm dead, why would i humble myself before anyone? and he says that if that's what i think, since my tongue is so long . . . maybe he thinks that i still look quite appealing . . . in short, he commands that i be taken outside. i no longer saw or remembered what was happening to marina and lyuda, i don't know if they are alive or not. they take me outside. they are dragging me by my arms, by my legs. they are hitting me against the wall, the railings, something metal . . . while they are carrying me someone is biting me, someone else is pinching me . . .i don't even know. i think, my god, when will death come? if only it were sooner . . . then . . . they carry me out, throw me near the entryway . . . and start kicking me. i lose consciousness . . . what happened after that, how many people there were, i don't remember. i come to after a while, i don't remember how long. a neighbor is bringing me clothing. i'm entirely covered with blood, she puts a dress on me. i remember that i said the same words over and over again: \"mamma, what happened, mamma, what have they done to us, where are we, whose house are we at?\" i can't make sense out of anything. there is a guy standing over me, i sort of know him, he served in afghanistan, his name is igor, he brought me indoors. when they all went to the third entryway and killed a person there, igor gathered his courage, took me into his arms, and brought me to the neighbors', even though he's small-minded, he put himself at risk. igor agayev is azerbaijani; he served in afghanistan. there are three brothers. the older brother also served there, i think; now he's stationed here, on the border, in armenia. igor brought me to the neighbors', and then helped me come to my senses, saying, \"karina, i know you, calm down, i'm not one of them.\" how do i know who's who and what's what? i come to, and they clean me up. i was covered in blood. then papa . . . i saw papa, i saw mamma. and marina, too . . . igor was there when they dragged marina and lyuda out from under the bed . . . marina . . . lyuda said that she was russian, they said, we'll let you go, we aren't touching the russians, go. and while they are dragging marina out she decides she's going to tell them she's azerbaijani. igor immediately grabs marina's and lyuda's hands, because he knows marina, and knows that she is armenian and is our sister, and takes her to the second floor to a neighbor's and starts pounding on the door so she will open up. she opens the door and igor pushes them in there. so they survived. my sister lyuda lost consciousness after the bandits started stealing things. while they were going downstairs, taking things downstairs, then coming back up again, lyuda seized the opportunity and crawled under the bed and stayed there. then, when she was herself again, she found a torn night shirt and put it on, and some sort of robe and went to a neighbor's on the fourth floor, the one whose apartment i had watched the crowd from, the friend of ours, and knocked on the door. the neighbor opened and said, \"i'm not going to let you in the apartment because i'm afraid of them. but i'll give you some stockings and we'll leave the building.\" lyuda says, \"i'll stay at your place because of what's going on, they keep going up and down the stairs.\" it was just for a moment, just a moment in life, but the neighbor wouldn't consent. lyuda came back to our place and lay under the bed . . . i came to. mother was there. i can't remember my supervisor's telephone number, but something had to be done. somehow i remembered and called, and he came to get us. he didn't have any idea what was going on. he thought we were simply afraid, he didn't know that they were killing us and that we had passed between life and death. he came and got us and took us to the police precinct. there they looked us over. i was having trouble walking, my lungs hurt badly, it was hard to breathe . . . my supervisor's name is urshan feyruzovich mamedov. he's the head of our administration. they took us there. when we were leaving, i saw a great number of buses full of soldiers at the entrance to town. the buses were ordinary passenger buses. there were very many soldiers. we left around eleven, right after eleven. if these people could stop what was happening they could save a great many lives . . . because the crowd was moving on, toward the school, and what was going on there . . . i think everyone know not only in sumgait, not only in yerevan. because there they murdered them all one after the next, without stopping. after us. i think 14 people died in microdistrict no. 3, and 10 to 12 of them were from buildings 4, 5, and 6. in our building one person died, and one old woman died from building 16, that's the building in front of ours. there young azerbaijani men stopped the mob and wouldn't let it into their building. incidentally, when we were at the neighbors', marina called our relatives to warn them, so they would all know what was happening. i called a aunt in microdistrict no. 5. they have three neighbors who are armenians. i said, \"run quickly, i can't explain what's going on; hide, do what you can, just stay alive. hide at azerbaijanis', ones who won't give you away.\" at that moment three people came in, policemen. i think they were azerbaijanis. i was in such awful condition, my face was completely distorted my lips were puffed up, there was blood, my eye was swollen, no one thought i would ever see anything out of that eye again . . . my forehead was badly cut, and one-half of my face was pushed out forward. no one would have thought that i would survive, get my normal appearance back, and be able to grasp anything at all. i started to scream at those people, why did you come, who sent you here, no one wants you here, haven't you killed people people yet, what are you doing here? one of the soldiers said, \"don't scream at us. we're muslims, but we're not from the sumgait police. they called in from daghestan.\" so at that point the daghestan police were there. when we got to the police precinct there were an awful lot of police there, there were soldiers, police with dogs, ambulances, firemen . . . i don't know, maybe they were waiting for people to bring them the goners and the seriously injured to treat them there in the police precinct. i don't know what they were there for. there were also doctors from baku there. they examined lyuda and me and said, \"these women need to go to the maternity home, but we don't know what to do with the rest.\" so they took us, and i lost contact with my parents, my boss, everyone. my boss said, \"don't worry, i'll find you, no matter where you are, no matter what happens.\" we went to the hospital. there we were examined by a department head from the sumgait maternity home, pashayeva, i think her name was. she examined us. the ambulance was from baku; i figured out that the sumgait ambulances hadn't done anything, they didn't respond to any calls. people called and neither the police nor the ambulances showed any sign of life. that doctor looked me over and i could tell from her behavior that something very good had happened, for she became quite glad. i even thought to myself, \"god, can it be that nothing all that bad is wrong?\" she looks me over and says, \"now why are you suffering so? you don't know what your people have been doing, your people did even worse things.\" and i think, great, i have to deal with her . . . and i felt so bad, i thought, why don't i just die so as not to have to hear more stuff like this from people like her? here i am in this condition and being told about something that our people did. i just didn't have the energy to say, \"how could our people possibly be smart enough to think of something that yours haven't already done?\" i stayed there. then they brought in another woman, ira b., she was married, and she was raped in her own apartment, too. there were three of us, ira, lyuda, and 1. the next morning they took lyuda and ira away. they didn't do anything to help us. this was in the old maternity home, in the combined block. they didn't do anything more than examine me, that was it. i didn't want any shots or tranquilizer, nothing. what shots could have calmed me down? i didn't even want to look at them. i lay in the ward. either it just worked out that way or they did it on pur- pose, but i was alone. i was alone even though the wards were packed. that same evening a woman came by and asked me what was wrong with me, that my face was disfigured. she asked what had happened to me, and i said, \"better to ask your brother what happened, there's no point in asking me, your brother can better explain what happened.\" she fell into a faint. all the doctors threw themselves at her, and the doctor categorically forbade anyone to come into my ward. then people from work came to see me, my boss, his daughter; they brought me clothing, because i was literally naked. the only thing i had on was a dress, but the woman who gave it to me was very short, and the dress was way up above my knees, and the woman orderly said, \"i can't believe you put on such a short dress, who are you showing off your legs to here?\" i went back to my ward thinking, just one more thing from something. people from work came and brought me something in a sack, apples, i think, three or four pounds, but i couldn't take them. i had become so weak that it was just embarrassing. i said that i couldn't take the apples, and really didn't have any appetite. no one had to bring me anything. some woman took the sack . . . and, oh yes! . . . then i heard that the head doctor tell a nurse that my medical history should be hidden or torn up completely so that no one would know that i was an armenian, maybe they wouldn't figure it out from looking at me. so they must have been thinking that there would be some kind of attack, that something else would happen. that it would be worse. or, perhaps, someone was outside on the street, i don't know. in any case, i didn't sleep a wink that night. the next morning they picked me up, a whole police detail, put me in a bus, and off we went. i didn't even know where they were taking me. they took me to the club where the troops were, the very one i was in that ill-fated evening. i got off the bus. near the city party committee there were a great many troops, tanks, armored personnel carriers; the whole scene was terrible. i saw a few people i knew there, and that calmed me a little. i had already thought that i was the only one left. so there were five or six of us left in sumgait after that night. i still didn't know what happened to my parents, they didn't come to see me in the hospital, and my boss told me that everything was fine. i didn't know whether to believe him or not. maybe he was just trying to calm me down, maybe something happened on the way. then i went to the club and saw a lot of people i knew. they all knew one another, they were all kissing each other and asking, \"what happened, what went on?\" two days later they came to see me from work. they were there all the time. each day they came, showed interest, and were constantly bringing me money. they did everything they could. of course i'm most thankful to my boss, the only one of my colleagues who didn't lose his presence of mind and who didn't change his opinions, neither before, nor after, nor in the heat of the moment, no matter what happened. he constantly took an interest. a sincere interest, from the heart . . . then, about two days later, the secretary of the party committee came, not from our party organization, but from the first trust, which ours is part of, comrade kerimov, a very important figure in our town. he made arrangements with the emergency medical personnel to take me away, because if i sat down by myself i couldn't get up or lie down again. there was something wrong with my lungs, it was hard to breathe. they examined me there several times, there i lay were several doctors, they all thought that . . . that it must just be from all the blows, i don't know. they didn't diagnose anything in particular. when i was in the maternity home i even asked . . . i made it a point of insisting that they take me to the trauma section because i felt so awful. there was no way something inside wasn't broken, my ribs . . . well they took me there and took x-rays and said that everything was fine. there were emergency medical workers on duty in the club. the mother of one of marina's friends was there. she was the head doctor at the sumgait children's clinic. they had every kind of antifever agent in the world, which was exactly what i needed at that moment, i thought. i said that i was having great difficulty breathing, i couldn't seem to get enough air, something was wrong with me. they put tight bandages around my chest and waist. later i overheard some people saying that i had been cut all over. i think they just saw me being all bandaged up and decided that my breasts and face had been cut . . . but i wasn't cut. they took us to the khimik boarding house. we lived there a long time. soon appeared representatives . . . they were agitating. at first people would not talk to them, and drove them off. one of the armenian women shouted, \"we demand that seidov come!\" the response was, \"it's seidov who sent us.\" seidov is the chairman of the azerbaijani council of ministers. the woman said, \"we'll only see seidov's daughter, have her come here, we'll do the same things to her that they did to our daughters, and then we'll deal with you agitators.\" and so on. more of them said, \"have seidov himself come.\" this went on day in, day out. the agitators kept coming and coming, this drove us out of our wits. then people gradually started departing for yerevan because they realized it was senseless to stay. everything got on our nerves: the smell, the small children. there were children at the sk club, children who had literally just come out of the maternity home. what were they doing in a club that didn't even have running water all the time? at first we had to pay to eat there. they even overcharged us, as it turned out. on the second day someone told us that they would bring us food for free. the children were ill. everything stank there. well imagine about 3,000 people in a small movie theater with seating for no more than 500. you couldn't sit or lie down, it was impossible to even move. the stench was awful. even the smallest infants took ill overnight there. i heard that they were arriving seriously ill in yerevan, the infants. they have to be washed, they have to be bathed, not to mention that we, the adults, were ill and needed care. people were fainting right and left. i just don't know, everyone was crying, everyone . . . only the young people, the men, somehow managed to keep it together. but the women were in a constant state of panic. it seemed to everyone that they would come any minute and kill and stab. it seemed clear that we had been gathered together purposely, like during the war, so that they could burn the movie theater and there wouldn't be a single armenian left. then people went up to the attic. i didn't see them, i only heard them, because i was lying down and couldn't get up. i lay right on the stage, we had some room there. apparently they caught two people with either oil or gas. i think they wanted to burn the theater. maybe someone saw them, i didn't. i was in no condition to open my eyes. everyone was suspicious of everyone else. they would ask, \"aren't you an azerbaijani? i think i saw you somewhere, i think you're an azerbaijani.\" they led out all the men and started letting them back in by checking their passports, relatives might be covering for each other. half of the people did not have any documents. there were people who had run out of their homes in nothing but a pair of pants and slippers, or wearing just a shirt, not like they should have, with their ids. so on the 28th, on sunday, i think, the police did nothing to help us. on monday everything resumed where it had left off on block 41a. they didn't spare a soul there: not children, not pregnant women, nobody. they killed, they burned, they hacked with axes, just everything possible. they murdered the melkumian family whom i knew, my mother worked with them. their daughter- in-law went to school with my older sister. they were brutally murdered. only the two daughters-in-law survived. by a miracle one was able to save herself, she ran away, the neighbors wouldn't take her in, so she ran about the building until she found refuge. she was pregnant and had two small children. this all continued on monday in block 41a, on the 29th, when the troops were already in the city. they murdered people, they overturned automobiles, and they burned entire families. they say they didn't even know for sure if the people were armenians or not. i heard that the lezgins suffered, too. i'm not sure myself, i didn't see any lezgins who had been injured. they burned cars so it's very difficult now to say exactly who died and who didn't. it was very difficult to identify the corpses, or rather, what remained of the corpses after they were doused in gasoline and burned . . . it's all very hard to imagine, of course i heard that many people disappeared without a trace, from the btz plant two people, including a woman who worked the night shift, aunt razmella, who also lived in microdistrict 3. they were stopping buses between baku and sumgait. in the evening people who had been visiting baku were returning to sumgait, and people from baku were going home from sumgait, and there were students, too. they were simply savagely murdered. they were stopping the buses, the drivers immediately did what they were told because there was just no other way to deal with that hoard of brutally minded people. they stopped the buses, dragged the armenians out and killed them on the spot. i didn't see it myself, but i heard that they put them all in a pile so as to burn them. later it was hard to discern from the corpses, well you can't call them corpses, you had to figure out from the ashes who it was. l heard that two fellows saved two women, one a student, ira g., if i'm not mistaken. she was in the hospital a long time after that, and she still can't figure out who saved her. she was also brutally raped and beaten and thrown onto a pile of corpses. the fellow pulled her out of that whole pile of corpses, put his coat on her, took her into his arms, and carried her to the city. i still can't imagine how he managed to do that. i heard that from engels grigorian. he knows her, apparently. well a lot of people went to that hospital anyway. she was in the hospital and singing a song in armenian, and they wrote the words down, and, i think he still has that piece of paper, because he says that a lot of people now have that song, the one she sang in the hospital where she lay in such bad shape. they couldn't find the guy who saved her. he left her in someone's apartment and called the ambulance, she was in such awful shape that, probably, like me, she couldn't remember anyone's face. i think that i knew one of the people who broke into our house, maybe i had talked with him once. but i received so many blows everything was just knocked out of my head. i can't remember to this day who he was. then, it seems, i saw the secretary of the directorate's party organization, where marina works. she goes to school and works, she goes to night school at azi, and works by day at the khimzashchita construction and installation administration. i'm the secretary of the komsomol organization at our administration and often met with the secretaries of party and komsomol organizations. we had joint meetings. i know them all, i've even talked with them, and he, i know, is from armenia. an azerbaijani, but from armenia. it became obvious that many of those people were azerbaijanis born in armenia. they took me to various police stations, to the police precinct, and to the procuracy, because the ussr procuracy got involved in the case, and i iden- tified the photographs of people who i could more or less recognize. they showed me the people who were in our apartment, they're working on our case, but i can't even recognize them, although it was proved that they were the ones, they're processing it somehow. they tell me that they know that someone held me by the arm and someone else held me by the leg when they were dragging me. there was someone else in our apartment who did not even touch me, he just stole a blanket and an earring or something like that. all these people, all of them, as much as i've heard about them and seen them, they were all from kafan. the secretary of the party organization is named najaf, najaf rzayev. he was there when everything started. it must have been him because i didn't recognize anyone else in the crowd whom i knew besides him. all the more since i told him, \"listen, you do something, because you know me.\" he turned away and went toward the bedroom, where marina was. well you couldn't see marina anyway. there was such a noisy confusion of people that you couldn't make out anyone. all of it flew right out of my head, and then gradually i became myself again, at the city party committee . . . there were military people there. i told them what went on, and they wrote it all down. i told them his name. on march 8 the secretary of our first trust party organization, the one we're part of, came to see us, his name is najaf rzayev. i tell mamma, \"if he's here despite the fact that i gave his name, it means that either his alibi has been confirmed or, probably, that they think i'm crazy, not responsible for my words.\" he said, \"what did they do to you, how awful, myself, i hid an armenian family.\" then after some time goes by he comes back again and says something entirely different: \"i wasn't at home, my family and i went to baku.\" i said, \"marina, what is he saying? he said something totally different before.\" after that i didn't go to see our procurator, our case is being handled by a procurator from voronezh, fedorov by name. fedorov told me that rzayev's case had just gotten to him, and there were so names involved. what are they doing with rzayev? did he prove his alibi or not? they just think that since i was hit in the head i can't say anything for sure, whether it was him or not. it will be an insult if he was in our apartment and doesn't have to pay for it, but at the same time i'm afraid to say i'm a hundred percent sure that it was he. because no mat- ter who i name, they tell me, no, you're wrong, he didn't do that, that one wasn't there. all the faces have gotten mixed up in my mind. who did what exactly i can't say. when they took me outside there was a whole crowd there, but i didn't see it, because i had my eyes closed all the time. it seemed to me that i always got it because of my eyes, people were always hassling me, for some reason it always seemed to me that my eyes are responsible. when they were beating my face i thought they were trying to put my eyes out. so i had my eyes closed, they took me outside and started to beat me. a young guy, 22, held my arms, he works at the btz plant. and right nearby, across the road from us, block 41, is where all this was going on. right across the road from us. the btz dormitory is over there, that's where he lives. now he's in custody, they even have proved, as far as i know, that it was he who killed shurik gambarian, the clarinet player from the third entryway of our building. one person in our building was killed, it was that man. a guy comes by who shared a room with the guy who was holding me. he saw that he was holding me by the arms and that he was beating me, but he didn't come over, he just looked and then went into the dormitory. a while after it was all over, people started making announcements in town saying that investigators had been summoned. that guy went and told them everything. now they've caught him, everything's been proved. now, evidently, they've been beating him, i don't know what they're doing with them over there, but he himself said that he was working the night shift at the plant. some young guy came to the plant and said, \"everyone who wants to kill armenians come to the bus station on saturday at ten.\" that was it. he said, the ones who wanted to, went. this was at the btz plant, during the night shift, probably, late friday night. it was at night, they were at the sauna together. and he said, what do you mean, do you understand what you are saying? the others were silent, probably, in their hearts they were thinking, i'm going to go. but they didn't say anything to one another. he said that he thought it important to to go, because he had heard a lot about what had happened in kafan, that they had killed their azerbaijani sisters, their mothers, burned villages, and all of that. that guy was also born in kafan. that is certain. and marina says that the secretary of the party organization is from armenia, too. from i've participated in the investigation a couple of times. i'm satisfied with them thus far. they summoned us and asked about what happened, and every word i said was recorded. i met some guy there . . . by the way, he was an armenian. i said that he was in our apartment, but what he did, i don't know. his last name was grigorian, eduard grigorian. he s from sumgait, from microdistrict 1. he was sentenced i think, to five years, not his first time. his mother is russian. i met with him at the kgb in baku, at the azerbaijani kgb. they took us there and showed me photographs. there were so many photographs, i think they even photographed those people who were caught at curfew, and i've got them all confused. i say, the face was about like this, the guy in the white coat with the red clasps. but he could take that coat off and burn it somewhere, and it would be like looking for a needle in a haystack. well. this guy, grigorian, i said, he was in our apartment, but he is so light-complected that he looks like a lezgin. i don't know what he did, i can't remember. maybe he beat me or raped me. but he was in our apartment. at the kgb he started asking me, pleading with me, there's no need for this, all this stuff, look me in the eyes, you're like a sister to me. i took a look at him and thought, \"my god, heaven forbid that i should have a brother like you.\" but they were satisfied with my responses, because i said everything without great certainty. i was there with mamma. then lyuda came in, but when she came in she got sick immediately. she wanted to kill him, she crawled over the table at him. she recognized him. when she came to, lyuda was lying on the balcony, the mob threw her there and all of them ran into the bedroom. we had all kinds of boxes with dishes in them, the dowries for all three sisters. they stole everything in the apartment, leaving only small things. at that moment lyuda came to and started remembering everything. well, seeing the faces, hearing the voices . . . two people were saying they could burn the apartment. another says, why burn the apartment when i've got three kids and no place to live. so this guy was in temporary housing, he didn't have anywhere to live, he was from sumgait. they were sure that they would get the apartment. besides, the neighbors were azerbaijani. why should they burn the apartment, they might burn azerbaijanis. that's what they said. how did they know there were azerbaijanis there, if they just picked a place, thinking that armenians lived there? we have a list of the residents for our part of the building, our name is in there, but how could they know that azerbaijanis lived on the other side of the wall from us? so they didn't set fire to our apartment. i don't know, i was in such bad shape that if all of it had come to a halt when i was outside, if someone had asked me what was happening, i would have said that a civil war was going on. well, maybe not civil . . . but probably civil, because when they were beating me i opened my eyes and saw that all the neighbors were standing on their balconies and watching, like at a free horror film. so a civil war was going on, and only the armenians were being fought. if it were a world war or something like that, they would have been fighting everyone. but they only fought us. then i met some women from our building, some azerbaijanis. they are crying, they tell me, \"karina, we saw all of it, how could it happen?\" they're asking me! well i just don't know what to call it if a normal girl can stand there and watch what happened to me. i think that if it were the other way around either i wouldn't have been able to take it, or i would have tried to avert it, like that one azerbaijani woman did in front of our building. a woman lives there, an awful, dissipated woman, if you can call her a woman, the dissipated life she leads. two armenian families live there, in her part of the building. she came out on the balcony and saw what was happening to me and started to scream and curse. she came down to the entryway and said, \"you'll come in this entryway over my dead body.\" so not one of them took it in his head to go in that entryway. some folks were saying that those people were so out of control that they didn't even know what they were doing. i don't think that's true. they knew very well what they were doing if they didn't even lift a hand against that woman. they couldn't have cared less about her, but the fact that she was an azerbaijani stopped them. they were just beasts, they had smoked so much. when they came to our place they were all chewing something. i noticed: everyone who came into the apartment was chewing something. i think, my god, maybe i just think that? maybe i'm losing my mind? but no, they're all chewing something. maybe it is some kind of drug, it must be, because . . . at first glance they all seemed to be such normal people, young, clean-shaven, looking exactly as if they had come to some sort of celebration. but they were shouting something. they didn't talk, they shouted, as though there were deaf people there. they screamed and screamed: \"yeah, killing, killing, we're killing the armenians!\" only they didn't shout \"kill,\" they shouted \"gurun ermianlary.\" gurun literally means \"kill,\" or \"destroy.\" that's how it was! i'll continue. we hid in a captain's apartment, he's an azerbaijani, his wife is a tatar. we were sitting in their apartment, their kids were out in the yard. their kids knew a whole lot. this was in our part of the building, on the third floor. when mamma came to and couldn't find lyuda she took papa's hand, this was while the looters were stealing things, but they didn't pay attention because they were stealing things. apparently they had already ceased killing and switched to stealing. mamma found the courage to . . . a boy said to my mother \"where's the gold?\" mamma said he must have been 12 to 14 years old. he even looked russian, he was so fair-skinned. but the azerbaijanis from armenia are fair-skinned. i noticed they were all on the fair side. he shouted, they were all smashing things, and he asks mamma where the gold is. we kept our gold in the wardrobe with our important papers. in a little black bag, we kept everything in there. mamma doesn't really like to wear gold. she probably never even wore those things from the time they were bought for her. they took everything that was lying on the cheval glass. mamma thinks that the gold saved us. because they threw themselves at the gold, and mamma grabbed papa, who was trying to breathe. they had closed his mouth, bound his hands, and put a pillow and a chair on his face . . . they had shoved something into his mouth so he would suffocate. mamma grabbed him and tore all that stuff off . . . he had something in his mouth, he was having trouble breathing, his nose was filled with blood. mamma grabbed him and started running from the fifth down to the first floor because no one wanted to open their doors to them. mamma said that by accident, completely by accident that person opened his door, he was sleeping, and said, half-awake, \"what's happened?\" he sees that they are bloody. mamma said, \"at least go and find out what's happening to my daughters, even if they've burned them or murdered them, at least bring the corpses.\" he went looking for us. at that moment lyuda was under the bed. she says that after they left it seemed that someone was calling her name. when he quietly called her she couldn't get out from under the bed. she wanted to get out and was calling softly. she thought she was shouting, but in fact she was either silent or was only talking to herself, it just seemed to her that she was shouting. when she got out from under the bed everyone was gone. and again . . . she thought that she had lost her mind. i'll never leave here, never! to hell with it! it just seems that way to me, i'll come to eventually. but then, when everything had settled down, stopped, that mall brought lyuda down, and igor carried me in from outside. or first i was brought in, then lyuda, i don't remember what order it happened in. and mamma said, \"listen, they're all running around down there, shouting something or other, and running toward the other building.\" it had more or less calmed down where we were. who's dead, who's alive, we don't know. i tried to call my girlfriend. i had basically come to. mamma says, \"listen; let's go upstairs, at least get a mattress or something. we don't know how long we'll be here. maybe they didn't burn everything.\" i don't get it, all women have that feeling, they want to get something from their homes, maybe not everything was taken? i tell mamma, \"mamma, what do you need any of that for? to hell with it! we're alive, forget the rest of it, all of it!\" she says, \"no, let's go get at least something. maybe we'll leave here, spend the night at someone else's.\" mamma went upstairs, and their little boy, their son alik, was standing on the lookout. lie was standing there to see if they were coming. they only managed to run up there and grab something one time. he shouts, \"come back, they're coming!\" they didn't have enough time to get a lot, mattresses from one apartment, a blanket from another . . . mamma got my knitting . . . someone managed to grab our old things, the ones we never wore, out of the hall . . . someone took father's old coveralls. the neighbor, his wife, mamma and papa . . . marina went with them. i was in no condition to leave. neither was lyuda. we just sat. they ran out and we closed the door and just then we hear that the mob is on its way toward our place upstairs, they're dragging something again. they were going toward the other building, maybe over by the school, or . . . there was an unfinished building over there, people said they were going toward the basement or the unfinished building, they could gradually carry everything over there. then things more or less calmed down. i tried to call my boss. later there was more noise. we were on the third floor, in a one-bedroom apartment, and a woman lives in the one-bedroom place on the second floor, asya dallakian. she's an old woman, retired. she wasn't at home, at that time she was usually in the country, she has a married daughter there, and her grandson is in the army. she is only very rarely in town; she gets her retirement money and the apartment is essentially vacant. they started pounding on her door and broke it down. she had two or three beds in there, something like that, she's a 60-to 70-year-old woman who really does not even live there. probably she had some pots, a couple of metal bed frames and mattresses, and a television. when her grandson came she bought a television. they started wrecking everything. i started getting sick again. i think, \"my god, what is going on around here? when will this end?\" we turned off the lights and sat. as it turns out the people who weren't afraid, the ones who knew what was going on, knew not to turn off the lights. we didn't know, but they didn't come to where we were all the same. they all knew very well that he was a captain. he went out and closed the door, and we sat in his apartment. his last name was kasumov. he's an exserviceman, retired, works up at the fire station at some plant or other. he went out and stood at his door. they tell him, \"comrade captain, don't worry, we won't harm you, you're one of us.\" he went upstairs, and they say, \"aren't you taking anything from this apartment?\" he says, \"i don't need anything.\" and the women who were standing in the yard . . . we have a basement, full of water . . . the women who were standing in the yard saw. those guys, they left everything they stole on the first floor and ran upstairs again. the women threw everything they had time to into the basement, to save our property. some things were left: dirty pillows, two or three other things and a rug. a guy came downstairs, really mad, and he says, \"where's the rug? i just put it right here!\" they tell him, \"some guy came and took it and went off toward the school.\" he ran off in that direction. oh! i forgot the most important point. when igor picked me up in his arms, there were women standing there who saw everything that was going on. they just didn't tell me about it for a long time. the wife of that military man, she didn't want to kill my spirit, i was already dead enough. later she told me, that after they murdered uncle shurik in the third entryway one of them, the ringleader, apparently a young man, said, \"where's the girl who was here?\" and he became furious. the woman tells him, \"she came to . . . \" she didn't know what to say: think something up? someone carried her off? then they would comb the whole house and find me and our whole family. so the woman says, \"she came to and went to the basement.\" now, our basement is full of water. so the whole mob dashes off to the basement to look for me or my corpse. they took flashlights; they were up to their waists in water, water which had been standing there for years, and soot, and fuel oil. they climbed down in there to get me. then one of them said, \"there's so much water down there, she probably walked and walked and then passed out and died. she met her death in the basement. that's it, we can leave, no problem!\" i didn't know that, and when i was told, i felt worse. two times worse. a lot worse! so they didn't just want to pound me flat, something more awful was awaiting me . . . after that we of course didn't want to live in sumgait any longer. we really didn't want to go back to our apartment. when we moved, i went up there and started to quiver and shake all over, because i started remembering it all. although the neighbors all sobbed, it was all . . . so cheap . . . the people who sat in their apartments and didn't help us at a time like that. i think that they could have helped! i don't think that they were obligated to, but they could have helped us! because that one woman was able to stop that whole brutal crowd by herself. that means they could have, too. it would have been enough foe one man or women to say, what do you think you're doing?\" that's all! that would have done it. there were 60 apartments in our building. not one person said it! when i was lying on the ground and all those people were standing on their balconies i didn't hear anyone's voice, no one said what are you doing, leave her alone . . . mamma even told one of the neighbor women that if it had been an azerbaijani woman in my place they would have dropped a bomb if it would have killed even one armenian. they would have stood up for one of their own. true, they say that our neighbor from the fourth entryway, an old/ sick woman tried to stop the pogrom. the azerbaijanis have a custom: if a woman takes her scarf and throws it on the ground, the men are supposed to stop immediately. the old woman from the fourth entryway did that, but they stomped her scarf into the ground, pushed her off to the side, and said, \"if you want to go on living, you'll disappear into your apartment.\" so she left. that trick didn't work on them. even the neighbors who helped us move told me, ok, fine, calm down, forget that it happened. i said i'd only forget it if i told them right then that it had happened to their daughter--and if that didn't have any effect on them, then i would forget everything, too. imagine that it happened to your sister. and no one did anything.

            "i don't know the exact meaning of uart, but i think it is something like universal arithmetic receiver transmitter. normally, the older boards have a 8250 or 16450 uart on board. those chips generate an irq for every char they received. the 16550 uart has an internal 16 byte buffer, so - with the right software installed - it generates an irq every 16 chars. if you ran dos, you don't need a 16550, because dos runs only one task at a time and the whole cpu-power could be used for the transfer. but if you are running a multitasking os such as os/2, unix, etc. ( windows ? :-) ), the cpu cannot work the whole time with one task. the result are lost characters or broken transmissions because of timeouts. no. the only diffrence is that internal modems have the uart on board, whereas external modems are connected to the computer over a serial port which has the uart on board. i use a zyxel1496b with a 16550uart under coherent 4.0. i'm very satisfied with it but i think that nearly everyone is satisfied with his own modem. michael",

            "ah, now here is the core question. let me suggest a scenario. we will grant that a god exists, and uses revelation to communicate with humans. (said revelation taking the form (paraphrased from your own words) 'this infinitely powerful deity grabs some poor schmuck, makes him take dictation, and then hides away for a few hundred years'.) now, there exists a human who has not personally experienced a revelation. this person observes that not only do these revelations seem to contain elements that contradict rather strongly aspects of the observed world (which is all this person has ever seen), but there are many mutually contradictory claims of revelation. now, based on this, can this person be blamed for concluding, absent a personal revelation of their own, that there is almost certainly nothing to this 'revelation' thing? absent this better language, and absent observations in support of the claims of revelation, can one be blamed for doubting the whole thing? here is what i am driving at: i have thought a long time about this. i have come to the honest conclusion that if there is a deity, it is nothing like the ones proposed by any religion that i am familiar with. now, if there does happen to be, say, a christian god, will i be held accountable for such an honest mistake? sincerely, ray ingles ingles@engin.umich.edu",

            "> i'm leaning... sirach... is more directly referenced by james > than job or ruth is... in any nt verse i've seen. it would help if you mentioned chapter and verse from sirach and from james. job 5:13 (\"he taketh the wise in their craftiness\") seems to be quoted in 1 corinthians 3:19. james 5:11 (\"you have heard of the patience of job\"), while not a quote, implies that james and his listeners are familiar with a story of a man named job who exhibited exemplary patience. it is possible that the story they know is not that found in the hebrew bible, but rather another similar and related story. (one has the same problem with direct quotes.) again, matthew 1:5 (\"boaz begat obed of ruth\") tells us that matthew knew a story about a woman named ruth who married a man called boaz and became the ancestor of david. since ruth is not mentioned in the ot outside the book of ruth, it seems likely that matthew was familiar with the book and respected it, and thought ruth important enough to be one of the few women mentioned in the genealogy. references like this do not prove that the nt writer considered his ot source inspired or inerrant or canonical. but neither do direct quotes.",

            "we here at ibm have the same problem with our workstations. i was also shocked when i first realized that you have to offset lines from fills by about 16 bits (assuming 24 bit z buffer). this seems huge, but is only 1/256 of the dynamic range. in those terms it doesn't seem so bad. what is happening is that the interpolation in z is not totally linear, due mainly to roundoff, i believe. so the polygon is not planar in z, but is more like a ruffles potato chip. ditto with lines. when you start/end at different x/y values, the \"ridges\" are out of phase, resulting in the stitch effect. you have the same problem if you try to draw 1 polygon right on top of another, but with different vertices. you will likely see a smeared effect where they overlap. example: try polygon 1: (100,100,100) (100,200,100) (200,200,100) (200,100,100) polygon 2: (125,125,100) (125,175,100) (175,175,100) (175,125,100) your implementation is correct. in fact, we do a similar trick when rendering primitives that have lines and polygons - such as nurbs surfaces with isoparametric lines. without the trick, the lines appear stitched, as you say. when the application draws lines/polygons independently, the system does not have the smarts to automatically do the z shifting, so the application must do it. this is what you have discovered and are doing. bravo!

            "sterrenkundig symposium 'compacte objecten' op 26 april 1993 in het jaar 1643, zeven jaar na de oprichting van de universiteit van utrecht, benoemde de universiteit haar eerste sterrenkundige waarnemer. hiermee ontstond de tweede universiteitssterrenwacht ter wereld. aert jansz, de eerste waarnemer, en zijn opvolgers voerden de utrechtse sterrenkunde in de daaropvolgende jaren, decennia en eeuwen naar de voorhoede van het astronomisch onderzoek. dit jaar is het 350 jaar geleden dat deze historische benoeming plaatsvond. de huidige generatie utrechtse sterrenkundigen en studenten sterrenkunde, verenigd in het sterrekundig instituut utrecht, vieren de benoeming van hun 'oervader' middels een breed scala aan feestelijke activiteiten. zo is er voor scholieren een planetenproject, programmeert de studium generale een aantal voordrachten met een sterrenkundig thema en wordt op de dies natalis aan een astronoom een eredoctoraat uitgereikt. er staat echter meer op stapel. studenten natuur- en sterrenkunde kunnen op 26 april aan een sterrenkundesymposium deelnemen. de onderwerpen van het symposium zijn opgebouwd rond een van de zwaartepunten van het huidige utrechtse onderzoek: het onderzoek aan de zogeheten 'compacte objecten', de eindstadia in de evolutie van sterren. bij de samenstelling van het programma is getracht de deelnemer een zo aktueel en breed mogelijk beeld te geven van de stand van zaken in het onderzoek aan deze eindstadia. in de eerste, inleidende lezing zal dagvoorzitter prof. lamers een beknopt overzicht geven van de evolutie van zware sterren, waarna de zeven overige sprekers in lezingen van telkens een half uur nader op de specifieke evolutionaire eindprodukten zullen ingaan. na afloop van elke lezing is er gelegenheid tot het stellen van vragen. het dagprogramma staat afgedrukt op een apart vel. het niveau van de lezingen is afgestemd op tweedejaars studenten natuur- en sterrenkunde. ook andere belangstellenden zijn van harte welkom! tijdens de lezing van prof. kuijpers zullen, als alles goed gaat, de veertien radioteleskopen van de radiosterrenwacht westerbork worden ingezet om via een directe verbinding tussen het heelal, westerbork en utrecht het zwakke radiosignaal van een snel roterende kosmische vuurtoren, een zogeheten pulsar, in de symposiumzaal door te geven en te audiovisualiseren. prof. kuijpers zal de binnenkomende signalen (elkaar snel opvolgende scherp gepiekte pulsen radiostraling) bespreken en trachten te verklaren. het slagen van dit unieke experiment staat en valt met de technische haalbaarheid ervan. de op te vangen signalen zijn namelijk zo zwak, dat pas na een waarnemingsperiode van 10 miljoen jaar genoeg energie is opgevangen om een lamp van 30 watt een seconde te laten branden! tijdens het symposium zal er niet zo lang gewacht hoeven te worden: de hedendaagse technologie stelt ons in staat live het heelal te beluisteren. deelname aan het symposium kost f 4,- (exclusief lunch) en f 16,- (inclusief lunch). inschrijving geschiedt door het verschuldigde bedrag over te maken op abn-amro rekening 44.46.97.713 t.n.v. stichting 350 jus. het gironummer van de abn-amro bank utrecht is 2900. bij de inschrijving dient te worden aangegeven of men lid is van de nnv. na inschrijving wordt de symposiummap toegestuurd. bij inschrijving na 31 maart vervalt de mogelijkheid een lunch te reserveren. het symposium vindt plaats in transitorium i, universiteit utrecht. voor meer informatie over het symposium kan men terecht bij henrik spoon, p/a s.r.o.n., sorbonnelaan 2, 3584 ca utrecht. tel.: 030-535722. e-mail: henriks@sron.ruu.nl. ******* dagprogramma ************************************** 9:30 ontvangst met koffie & thee 10:00 opening prof. dr. h.j.g.l.m. lamers (utrecht) 10:10 dubbelster evolutie prof. dr. h.j.g.l.m. lamers 10:25 radiopulsars prof. dr. j.m.e. kuijpers (utrecht) 11:00 pulsars in dubbelster systemen prof. dr. f. verbunt (utrecht) 11:50 massa & straal van neutronensterren prof. dr. j. van paradijs (amsterdam) 12:25 theorie van accretieschijven drs. r.f. van oss (utrecht) 13:00 lunch 14:00 hoe zien accretieschijven er werkelijk uit? dr. r.g.m. rutten (amsterdam) 14:35 snelle fluktuaties bij accretie op neutronensterren en zwarte gaten dr. m. van der klis (amsterdam) 15:10 thee & koffie 15:30 zwarte gaten: knippen en plakken met ruimte en tijd prof. dr. v. icke (leiden) 16:05 afsluiting 16:25 borrel",

            "true. at first, the news media seemed entranced by all the new gizmos the military was using, not to mention the taped video transmissions from the missiles as they zeroed in on their targets. but later, and especially after the bunker full of civilians was hit, they changed their tone. it seemed to me that they didn't have the stomach for the reality of war, that innocent people really do die and are maimed in warfare. it's like they were only pro-gulf-war as long as it was \"nice and clean\" (smart missiles dropping in on military hqs), but not when pictures of dead, dying, and maimed civilians started cropping up. what naive hypocrites! [ discussion about blanket-bombing and a-bombs deleted.] ^^^^^^^^^ i should have said here \"militarily justified\". it seems from your comments below that you understood this as meaning \"morally justified\". i apologize. i have often wondered about this. i've always thought that the first bomb should have been dropped on japan's island fortress of truk. a good, inpenatrable military target. the second bomb could've been held back for use on an industrial center if need be. but i digress. yes, i have heard that we found evidence (after the war, btw) that japan was seriously considering surrender after the first bomb. unfortunately, the military junta won out over the moderates and rejected the us's ulimatum. therefore the second bomb was dropped. most unfortunate, imo. i don't regret the fact that sometimes military decisions have to be made which affect the lives of innocent people. but i do regret the circumstances which make those decisions necessary, and i regret the suffering caused by those decisions. [...] actually, it was the fact that both situations existed that prompted us and allied action. if some back-water country took over some other back-water country, we probably wouldn't intervene. not that we don't care, but we can't be the world's policman. or if a coup had occured in kuwait (instead of an invasion), then we still wouldn't have acted because there would not have been the imminent danger perceived to saudi arabia. but the combination of the two, an unprovoked invasion by a genocidal tyrant and the potential danger to the west's oil interests, caused us to take action. [...] i'm not setting up a strawman at all. if you want to argue against the war, then the only logical alternative was to allow hussein to keep kuwait. diplomatic alternatives, including sanctions, were ineffective. well, in a sense, yes. they probably had no idea of what end hitler would lead their nation to. they suffered along with the rest. why does this bother you so much? the world is full of evil, and circumstances are not perfect. many innocents suffer due to the wrongful actions of others. it it regretable, but that's the-way-it-is. there are no perfect solutions. [...] probably because we're not the saviors of the world. we can't police each and every country that decides to self-destruct or invade another. nor are we in a strategic position to get relief to tibet, east timor, or some other places. tell me how we could stop them and i'll support it. i, for one, do not agree with the present us policy of \"sucking up to them\" as you put it. i agree that it is deplorable. are they? or are they supposed to reflect the population of the locale where the trial is held? (normally this is where the crime is committed unless one party or the other can convince the judge a change of venue is in order.) i'm not an expert on california law, or even us law, but it seems that this is the way the system is set up. you can criticize the system, but let's not have unfounded allegations of racial prejudice thrown around. no, not at all. the point is that the fact that there were no blacks on the first jury and that rodney king is black is totally irrelevant. germans, perhaps. \"peers\" doesn't mean \"those who do the same thing\", like having murderers judge murderers. it means \"having people from the same station in life\", presumably because they are in a better position to understand the defendent's motivation(s). ok, granted. however, you are using this reasoning as part of *your* logical argument in this discussion. this is not a court of law. the media is not totally monolithic. even though there is a prevailing liberal bias, programs such as the macneil-lehrer news hour try to give a balanced and fair reporting of the news. there are even conservative sources out there if you know where to look. (hurrah for rush!) btw, i never used the word \"conspiracy\". i don't accept (without *far* more evidence) theories that there is some all-pervading liberal conspiracy attempting to take over all news sources. hardly. i didn't say that it's a good thing [tm] to kill innocent people if the end is just. unfortunately, we don't live in a perfect world and there are no perfect solutions. if one is going to resist tyranny, then innocent people on both sides are going to suffer and die. i didn't say it is ok -- it is unfortunate, but sometimes necessary. i would agree that it was evil in the sense that it caused much pain and suffering. i'm not so sure that it was unnecessary as you say. that conclusion can only be arrived at by evaluating all the factors involved. and perhaps it *was* unnecessary as (let's say) we now know. that doesn't mean that those who had to make the decision to bomb didn't see it as being necessary. rarely can one have full known of the consequences of an action before making a decision. at the time it may have seemed necessary enough to go ahead with it. but don't assume that i feel the bombing was *morally* justified -- i don't! i just don't condemn those who had to make a difficult decision under difficult circumstances. you certainly are not in such a position if you are a moral relativist. i, as an absolutist, am in a position to judge, but i defer judgment. wrong. they were neither moral then nor now. they seemed necessary to those making the decisions to bring a quick end to the war. i simply refuse to condemn them for their decision. one day i will stand before jesus and give account of every word and action; even this discourse in this forum. i understand the full ramifications of that, and i am prepared to do so. i don't believe that you can make the same claim. and btw, the reason i brought up the blanket-bombing in germany was because you were bemoaning the iraqi civilian casualties as being \"so deplorable\". yet blanket bombing was instituted because bombing wasn't accurate enough to hit industrial/military targets in a decisive way by any other method at that time. but in the gulf war, precision bombing was the norm. so the point was, why make a big stink about the relatively few civilian casualties that resulted *in spite of* precision bombing, when so many more civilians (proportionately and quantitatively) died under the blanket bombing in ww2? even with precision bombing, mistakes happen and some civilians suffer. but less civilians suffered in this war than any other iany other in history! many iraqi civilians went about their lives with minimal interference from the allied air raids. the stories of \"hundreds of thousands\" of iraqi civilian dead is just plain bunk. yes, bunk. the us lost 230,000 servicemen in ww2 over four years and the majority of them were directly involved in fighting! but we are expected to swallow that \"hundreds of thousands\" of *civilian* iraqis died in a war lasting about 2 months! and with the allies using the most precise bombs ever created at that! what hogwash. if \"hundreds of thousands\" of iraqi civilians died, it was due to actions hussein took on his own people, not due to the allied bombing. regards,",
            "as the sharks' season came to a close tonight, i will start a series of posts, trying to revisit the players, the trades, the moves, etc., that went through for the sharks for the past season. if you are uninterested, since i will have the words sharks review in the subject heading in these postings, you can kill them. i will first try to evaluate how the players did. these ratings, of course, are subject to my own biases, but i hope that i can try to be as objective as possible. i will evalute players who finished the season with the sharks and/or did not play for another nhl team this season. thus, then, let's go to the goaltenders... #1 brian hayward season: 11th acquired: '91-92 from minnesota in dispersal draft grade: p (d) it is sad that his career has to come to this dim an end, a career that featured sharing three jennings trophies (with patrick roy, in '87, '88, and '89). it would indeed be unfair for me to do anything but give him a passing grade (and skip the letter grading), but he had simply been awful on ice this year, save for a bright spot or two, and even if he had been healthy, he would not be any more than the 3rd-string goalie. but hayward was a classy individual, who also figured in on the sharks' first ever victory, the 3rd game of the season last year against the calgary flames. as he retires, the fans will remember what a good guy he was. #30 jeff hackett season: 3rd acquired: '91-92, from n. y. islanders in expansion draft grade: c hackett, after (deservedly) winning the team mvp honors last season, simply wasted the year. other than a few good spots (57 saves against los angeles, almost-shutout against tampa bay, etc.), hackett, finishing with 85.6% save percentage and a 5.28 gaa, watched his status go from the team's #1 goalie to bench decoration at the end of the season. he was expected, early, to carry the team along; instead, he apparently became frustrated, but the an early injury that forced him to miss 12 games may have been a contributing factor, but upon return, he simply wasn't up to the task. he may not return next year. #31 wade flaherty season: 1st (still eligible as rookie) acquired: '91-92, signed as undrafted free agent grade: i (a-) it is pretty hard to evaluate a goaltender on just one game alone, thus the incomplete grade, but yet in the one start that he did get (against the calgary flames), flaherty was nothing but sharp for at least two periods. he started the season poorly in kansas city, but finished strong, prompting the blades' owner ron parker to comment that he should be a candidate for the ihl mvp honors. the upcoming ihl playoffs would be a major challenge for him as he tries to make it into the nhl; last year, he was a capable backup for arturs irbe in the throughout the season and in the turner cup playoffs, picking up all-star honors along with irbe; now it's time for him to show that he can share the job with irbe next year, because with prospects dan ryder, trevor robins, and scott cashman coming along, if he doesn't make it next year, he may not ever. #32 arturs irbe season: 1st acquired: '91-92, from minnesota in dispersal draft grade: b+ i may yet be overly critical of irbe in a year that he clearly established that he's a bona fide nhl goaltender, perhaps a bona fide #1 goaltender. he has provided most of the little highlight footage that the sharks team had, getting the team's first ever shut-out against the los angeles kings on december 26. he has been fearless in and out of the net, aggressively playing the puck and making passes, reminding people of a young ron hextall (except, of course, the goonism). yet he still needs to develop more consistency, which is hard to do with such a bad defense in front of him, but if the sharks are to challenge for a playoff spot next season, irbe's the key, as he demonstrated in being named as a star of the game 13 times in 32 starts.",

            "ok, with all the discussion about observed playback speeds with quicktime, the effects of scaling and so on, i thought i'd do some more tests. first of all, i felt that my original speed test was perhaps less than realistic. the movie i had been using only had 18 frames in it (it was a version of the very first movie i created with the compact video compressor). i decided something a little longer would give closer to real-world results (for better or for worse). i pulled out a copy of \"2001: a space odyssey\" that i had recorded off tv a while back. about fifteen minutes into the movie, there's a sequence where the earth shuttle is approaching the space station. specifically, i digitized a portion of about 30 seconds' duration, zooming in on the rotating space station. i figured this would give a reasonable amount of movement between frames. to increase the differences between frames, i digitized it at only 5 frames per second, to give a total of 171 frames. i captured the raw footage at a resolution of 384*288 pixels with the spigot card in my centris 650 (quarter-size resolution from a pal source). i then imported it into premiere and put it through the compact video compressor, keeping the 5 fps frame rate. i created two versions of the movie: one scaled to 320*240 resolution, the other at 160*120 resolution. i used the default \"2.00\" quality setting in premiere 2.0.1, and specified a key frame every ten frames. i then ran the 320*240 movie through the same \"raw speed test\" program i used for the results i'd been reporting earlier. result: a playback rate of over 45 frames per second. that's right, i was getting a much higher result than with that first short test movie. just for fun, i copied the 320*240 movie to my external hard disk (a quantum lp105s), and ran it from there. this time the playback rate was only about 35 frames per second. obviously the 230mb internal hard disk (also a quantum) is a significant contributor to the speed of playback. i modified my speed test program to allow the specification of optional scaling factors, and tried playing back the 160*120 movie scaled to 320*240 size. this time the playback speed was over 60 fps. clearly, the poster who observed poor performance on scaled playback was seeing quicktime 1.0 in action, not 1.5. i'd try my tests with quicktime 1.0, but i don't think it's entirely compatible with my centris and system 7.1... unscaled, the playback rate for the 160*120 movie was over 100 fps. the other thing i tried was saving versions of the 320*240 movie with \"preferred\" playback rates greater than 1.0, and seeing how well they played from within movieplayer (ie with quicktime's normal synchronized playback). a preferred rate of 9.0 (=> 45 fps) didn't work too well: the playback was very jerky. compare this with the raw speed test, which achieved 45 fps with ease. i can't believe that quicktime's synchronization code would add this much overhead: i think the slowdown was coming from the mac system's task switching. a preferred rate of 7.0 (=> 35 fps) seemed to work fine: i couldn't see any evidence of stutter. at 8.0 (=> 40 fps) i *think* i could see slight stutter, but with four key frames every second, it was hard to tell. i guess i could try recreating the movies with a longer interval between the key frames, to make the stutter more noticeable. of course, this will also improve the compression slightly, which should speed up the playback performance even more...",

(we don't need a good product because these duffuses in nyc would fill the arena for ottawa's record every year......1940!! haha (sorry, had ta say it)). if hockey (and other pro sports) had a similar system to europe, maybe teams like the rangers would be forced to compete (or get demoted the fourth division). we'd have many more teams...centres that aren't as big (like halifax or adirondack....ok, so halifax isn't a good example) would eventually get promoted, and every team would be somewhat competetive within its own division (unlike ottawa, sj, edmonton, etc.). fans would eventually get rewarded for their loyalty (or penalized for their neglect), and the league would be more interesting and dynamic every year because of the influx of newly promoted teams (and the halifax citadels win the stanley cup...i can dream, can't i??) look at british (or any european) soccer as an example (they never have fan problems). just someone who thinks our system really sucks barfly (feel free to flame me, my account ends today...hahahaha)",

(he was a vetran vomit comet rider, one of those anomalous people who don't get sick on the thing.) i didn't think of it as a \"constant sensation of falling\" so much as like swimming in air. it's very close to the sensations i feel when i'm scuba diving and i turn my head down and fins up. jerry: : >and what is the motion sickness : >that some astronauts occasionally experience? ron: : it is the body's reaction to a strange environment. it appears to be : induced partly to physical discomfort and part to mental distress. : some people are more prone to it than others, like some people are more : prone to get sick on a roller coaster ride than others. the mental : part is usually induced by a lack of clear indication of which way is : up or down, ie: the shuttle is normally oriented with its cargo bay : pointed towards earth, so the earth (or ground) is \"above\" the head of : the astronauts. about 50% of the astronauts experience some form of : motion sickness, and nasa has done numerous tests in space to try to : see how to keep the number of occurances down. i'm a volunteer in jsc's space biomedical laboratory where they do, among other things, some of the tests ron mentions. i was in one called the pre-flight adaptation trainer, which consisted of a chair on a several-degree-of-freedom motion base with moving geometric visual aids. the goal was to measure the victim's^h^h^h^h^h^h^h^h subject's responses and subjective physiological descriptions and see if repeated exposure to this environment could reduce future motion sickness symptoms. jerry -- i don't know of any former or active-duty astronauts who personally read this group. i know that bruce mccandless's office had been waiting anxiously for the space station redesign option i posted last week, but i don't think bruce reads the group himself. -- ken jenks, nasa/jsc/gm2, space shuttle program office kjenks@gothamcity.jsc.nasa.gov (713) 483-4368",

            "brian ceccarelli presents us with the fallacy of false dichotomy in stating that we must accept every thing in the books attributed to peter, or we must discount every other book of antiquity: mr ceccarelli, you seem to be stating that we must accept accept everything written in every \"historical\" document. somehow i doubt do that yourself that. thus since i doubt you accept everything written in every historical document, i would ask how you can thereby objectively justify complete faith in the words of the books attributed to peter. i shall now give an example of a document from antiquity, which i am sure you reject; it dates from the time of ramses ii (this was first presented here by matthew wiener). these inscriptions were carved soon after a battle, and were carved with the pharoah's specific approval so we have true originals, rather than mere copies. this account records the the battle of kadesh (circa 1285 bc), which occurred on the river orontes, (about 100 miles south of aleppo). the egyptians won this battle with the hittites, and ramses had his victory inscribed all over the place. a few of of these inscriptions have survived in near perfect form. it is a record of how the pharoah pretty much single-handedly defeated the hittites, after being separated from his troops. note that the egyptian wavers back and forth between first and third person. the following is from miriam lichtheim`s _ancient egyptian literature_ volume ii. my majesty caused the forces of the foes from hitti to fall on their faces, one upon the other, as crocodiles fall, into the water of the orontes. i was after them like a griffin; i attacked all the countries, i alone. for my infantry and my chariotry had deserted me; not one of them stood looking back. as i live, as ra loves me, as my father atum favors me, everything that my majesty has told i did it in truth, in the presence of my infantry and my chariotry. (note: this paragraph records not only ramses \"divine word,\" but also that there were thousands of witnesses to the event. now from the heart of battle.) then his majesty drove at a gallop and charged the forces of the foe from hitti, being alone by himself, none other with him. his majesty proceeded to look about him and found 2500 chariots ringing him on his way out ... no officer was with me, no charioteer, no soldier of the army, no shield-bearer; my infantry, my chariotry yielded before them, not one of them stood firm to fight with them. his majesty spoke: \"what is this, father amun? is it right for a father to ignore his son? are my deeds a matter for you to ignore? do i not walk and stand at your word? i have not neglected an order you gave. too great is he, the great lord of egypt, to allow aliens to step on his path! what are these asiatics to you, o amun, the wretches ignorant of god? have i not made for you many great monuments, ... i call to you, my father amun, i am among a host of strangers; all countries are arrayed against me, i am alone, there's none with me! ... the labors of many people are nothing, amun is more helpful than they; i came here by the command of your mouth, o amun, i have not transgressed your command!\" now though i prayed in a distant land, my voice resounded in southern thebes. i found amun came when i called to him, he gave me his hand and i rejoiced. he called from behind as if near by: \"forward, i am with you, i your father, my hand is with you, i prevail over a hundred thousand men, i am lord of victory, lover of valor!\" i found my heart stout, my breast in joy, all i did succeeded, i was like mont. ... i slaughtered among them at my will, not one looked behind him, not one turned around, whoever fell down did not rise. ... one called out to the other saying: \"no man is he who is among us, it is seth great-of-strength, baal in person; not deeds of man are these his doings, they are of one who is unique, who fights a hundred thousand without soldiers and chariots, come quick, flee before him, to seek life and breathe air; for he who attempts to get close to him, his hands, all his limbs grow limp. one cannot hold either bow or spears, when one sees him come racing along!\" my majesty hunted them like a griffin, i slaughtered among them unceasingly. so you see brian, we have a few original manuscripts recording the miraculous battle between the ramses and the hittites. do you reject them as being *completely* true? i suspect you do, and if so, then do you also, in your own words: \"question the existence of alexander the great, tilgrath pilisar iii, nero, caligula, josephus, cyrus the great, artexerxes?\" do you also thereby question all their documents? that`s the problem with your \"all or nothing\" approach. many ancient people used to mix a bit of fancy with their facts. so for you to say that we must either accept all of peter (and the rest of the new testament) or accept no records of antiquity at all, forces you thereby, to accept the verity of documents you probably do not find completely credible. as to your other argument that so many people have testified to jesus, that he must be true: i have three points. first, this is \"argumentum ad populum\" (ie: appeal to popular opinion); you cannot vote on truth. for instance, do the millions of hindu's past and present who testify to the reality of brahma, constitute actual evidence for the existence of brahma? how would you answer your own question in regards to the testimony of hindus: \"with a scoff of your keyboard, with near complete ignorance of the testimonies, are you going to say that that is all complete hooey?\" if you do so \"scoff,\" then how do you objectively justify your own special pleading? second, it is not at all clear that king solomon or king david testified to jesus. you can claim it to be clear, but that does not make it true. third, it is quite arguable that abraham lincoln was not christian, and that he had both a public and a private view of christianity. in fact there was much discussion about it in his day (yes, he was publically accused of being a deist. oh my). i am presently collecting a faq for lincoln as i've previously done for tyre, jefferson and etc. later, dave butler",

            "note: these trial updates are summarized from reports in the _idaho statesman_ and the local nbc affiliate television station, ktvb channel 7. randy weaver/kevin harris trial update: day 5. monday, april 19, 1993 was the fifth day of the trial. synopsis: government informant kenneth fadeley testified that randy weaver sold him two shotguns in violation of the national firearms act of 1934. u.s. district court judge edward lodge asks jurors not to hear accounts of the waco fire because of possible influences on the weaver/harris case. the testimony of fbi special agent greg rampton apparently ended without further incident, as it was mentioned neither by ktvb nor the _idaho statesman_. the day was highlighted by the testimony of kenneth fadeley, who had been posing as an outlaw biker and illegal guns person named gus magiosono. fadeley testified that he was acting as an informant for the bureau of alcohol, tobacco, and firearms in his dealings with randy weaver. fadeley began by stating that he had met weaver in 1987 at an aryan nations summer conference in hayden lake, idaho. the two then met again october 11, 1989 (note the huge separation in time) at a restaurant in sandpoint, idaho, to begin a weapons transaction. he stated that weaver had said, \"he felt like he (weaver) was being prepared to do something dangerous for the white cause.\" the two later met october 24, 1989 behind the restaurant and later went to a city park to make the sale. during this second meeting, fadeley was wearing a small recording device to tape the conversation. weaver allegedly showed him an h&r 12- gauge shotgun with a 13-inch barrel and an overall length of 19.25 inches. he additionally showed a remington 12-gauge shotgun with a 12.75-inch barrel and an overall length of 24.5 inches (nfa requires minimums of 18 inches for barrel length and an overall length of 26 inches). on tape, weaver is reported to have said that he could perform better work once his machine shop is set up. the two then discuss the possibility of future sales. fadeley then counts out three hundred dollars for the two guns and promises the balance of one-hundred fifty dollars when they next meet. (note that the atf could have simply arrested him here. why did they wait until january 1991 - over a year later - to arrest him? this is not explained). the next meeting took place on nov 30, 1989. fadeley stated that his \"source\" had only come up with one hundred dollars instead of the one-hundred fifty he'd promised. at this point, weaver suspected he was dealing with an informant, \"i had a guy in spokane tell me you were bad.\" fadeley managed to convince weaver otherwise. the _idaho statesman_ states explicitly that three tapes were made of conversations with randy weaver. thus, each of these meetings must have been recorded. however, the _statesman_ also reported that a tape of a telephone conversation involving vicki weaver (randy weaver's wife) was played to the court. there must have also been phone taps. these tapes were played to the court via both headphones and loudspeakers under the objections of gerry spence, weaver's attorney. spence said to a ktvb reporter that he wanted to make sure that the government proved its case, \"...if it has a case at all...\" according to the rules. randy weaver tore off his headphones and wept when he heard his wife's voice on the tape. u.s. district court judge edward lodge asked jurors not to hear accounts of the waco fire because of possible influences on the weaver/harris case. exactly how such information could affect this trial is not explained. other notes: sunday evening there was a report on ktvb concerning kevin harris. unnamed agents within the fbi admit that they are surprised that kevin harris is still alive. first, they were surprised that he survived the initial gunshot wound(s) sustained in the initial firefight at the y-junction. later, when randy weaver was struck by sniper fire the sniper had reported that harris had been struck (not weaver). finally, there was a report that the fbi agent who killed vicki weaver believed he was aiming at kevin harris instead. (this is what was reported). critics are charging that the fbi was blatantly trying to eliminate the only non-government witness to the deaths of samuel weaver and deputy marshal william degan. some local people believe that harris's survival is simply due to divine intervention.",

            "930418 do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the law. [honestly.] the word of sin is restriction. [would i kid you?] does one man's words encompass the majestic vision of thousands of individuals? quoting a man is not the same as quoting the order. taken out of context, words can be interpreted much differently than had one applied them within the confines of their original expression. i think this is the case regarding hymenaeus beta, frater superior of the order to which i belong. when he included that bit from merlinus x' he did us all a service. he showed us the extremes to which order members have been known to go in their fervor. i have little knowledge regarding reuss' background, but surely he was an unusual man, and he was an important force in the order for many years. yet as people change so do orders change, and while we look back so carefully at the dirty laundry of o.t.o. remember that this is only the surface skim and that many perspectives are now encompassed which extend beyond any one individual. i hope to show that there was and is much room for a difference of opinion within the order itself, perhaps by testing the limits myself. let us examine this issue a bit more closely.... \"in 1895, karl kellner (1850-1905), a wealthy austrian industrialist and paper chemist, as well as a high-grade mason, founded the ordo templi orientis. kellner had traveled widely in the east, where he met three adepts who instructed him specific magical practices. kellner's efforts to develop the order were later assisted by franz hartmann, heinrich klein and theodore reuss, who had worked together prior to joining the o.t.o. the order was first proclaimed in 1902 in reuss's masonic publication, 'oriflamme'. on kellner's death, reuss succeeded him as outer head [o.h.o.]. the 'jubilee' edition of the 'oriflamme', published in 1912, announced that the order taught secret of sexual magic. \"theodore reuss was an interesting character. born june 28, 1855 in augsburg, he entered masonry in 1876. he was a singer, journalist and possibly a spy for the prussian political police, infiltrating the socialist league founded by karl marx's daughter and her husband. reuss was later associated with william wynn westcott, a leader of the golden dawn, who later introduced him to john yarker. yarker chartered reuss to found the rites of memphis and mizraim in germany. after several attempts to concretize various masonic rites, reuss settled on the development of the o.t.o. \"the order experienced reasonably steady growth under reuss' leadership. for example, he chartered papus in france, rudolph steiner in berlin and h. spencer lewis in the usa. in 1912, the historic meeting between reuss and crowley occurred. crowley wrote that reuss came to him and accused him of revealing order secrets. when crowley looked at it afresh, the initiated interpretation of sexual magick unfolded itself to him for the first time. reuss appointed crowley as supreme and holy king of all the english speaking world, and it was this authorization that he invoked when publishing the material of the equinox. \"reuss resigned as outer head of the order in 1922 after suffering a stroke and named crowley his successor. all was well until 1925 when _the book of the law_ was translated into german. there was a break in the continuity of the order. manyk members split with the new o.h.o. over the book, which crowley was actively promulgating through the order. he had earlier revise dthe order rituals at reuss's request, deeply infusing the doctrines of the new aeon revelation.\" _an introduction to the history of the o.t.o._, by ad veritatem ix' within _equinox iii:10_, edited by hymenaeus beta, frater superior, rex summus sanctissimus, caliph of the united states of america, published by samuel weiser, 1990. there are many possible reasons that our frater superior included this material in _equinox iii:10_. and this is the real point, is it not? why did he wish to publish such things about the history of his own organization? does he represent a dogmatic threat to the principle of thelema? or is he exercising his true will and putting forth very complex pictures with no easy answers? a picture which leaves room for very many interpretations. it is quite easy for me to see, for example, that all of o.t.o. derived out of the dribble of faltering masonry, purchased by clever hucksters with an ounce of courage and some writing ability to aid them. and i can take that all the way down to our present caliph, whose feeble support of the 'law of thelema' is laughable at best. would i be thrown out of the order for speaking in this way? will i? i think not. why? because my frater will see it as a perspective, an interjection i am using as an example. my illustration shows that we may express things in the context of a larger work and the true significance of this may be quite difficult to apprehend at first. so it may be with oto and merlinus x'. please look o.t.o. more carefully. i do not support reuss's words myself, as i am not qualified to assess them, and i am critical of their pomposity. if i who am a member of the order take such a stand and am allowed to continue doing so, then what can this say about the health of the order? does it mean that the order has 'gone soft' and abandoned its moral principles? or does it mean that it is strong in its ability to let the will of universal kinship arise on its own, not shackled by some dogmatic requirement? how shall we resolve these two possibilities? i find a high calibre of individual associated with ordo templi orientis. they are often quite intelligent and sometimes very well versed in arcane or usual information. they are quite often artists and geniuses. having met some 20 longstanding members in the sf bay area (many who are or were very heavily involved with the order), i can vouch for the integrity of the organization as it stands. i have sometimes questioned the policy of hymenaeus beta. in these moments i followed my intuition, and i've found little to stop me from requesting a second initiation from a different o.t.o. body. i'm happily participating in social groups (feasts or initiations) and have come to know the gnostic mass well enough for my tastes. this doesn't make me an authority on order politics and explanations, however. i can only hypothesize and relay to you what i understand based on my limited contact with other members. i urge you not to take the words of merlinus x too far. there are many ways to interpret words, and many people who have become involved with the order feel very strongly about the sanctity of personal freedom and the preservation of individual vision. i welcome other comment on this issue and will be writing more in response to other posts in this thread. invoke me under my stars. love is the law, love under will. i am i!",

(this ?is something that most of us have direct experience of. 8-) now you have hit on the purpose of the church. it is by necessity the infallible interpreter of divine revelation. without the church, christianity would be nothing more than a bunch of little divisive sects. ?unless you are infallible, there are very few things you can be certain ?of. to the extent that doctrines rely on fallible human thinking, they ?cannot be certain. this argument of yours regarding the certainty of an observation or a conclusion is not necessarily substantiated by experience. it reminds me of the theoretical physicist who said that you can never be certain of a measurment because the sensor interferes with the field you are trying to measure. now, the experimental physicist will reply that although the measurement can never be made with absolute certainty, he is able to determine the certainty with which the measurement can be made, and this knowledge is often sufficient to render the measurement useful enough to allow evidence of the true condition of the field under observation. therefore, although our minds are finite and susceptible to error, our competence in arriving at inductive insights gives confidence in our ability to distinguish what is true from what is not true, even in areas not subject to the experimental method. ?darren f provine / kilroy@gboro.rowan.edu ?\"if any substantial number of [ talk.religion.misc ] readers read some ? wittgenstein, 60% of the postings would disappear.

            "to answer your irrelevant question, yes a person of color is human, but i still don't know what you mean by human being and you have merely begged the question without responding. by trying to inject the notion of race into the discussion, you muddy the waters without adding any insight whatever. the same parallel question could be \"is a polydactyl person a human being?\" you still have not answered what you mean by human being. please do so. you won't answer the question and instead drag in irrelevancies. if you want a definition of human being that does not depend on the vagaries of law, but holds solid whatever the law may rule, provide it for me. more irrelevancies. as larry margolis pointed out, the law has made special exceptions in order to include fetuses, but does not follow your version of human being. and as he pointed out, brain death is not a means of determining who has the rights of the living, but rather who has died. there is a significant difference. what i am wondering now is, has your argument so failed you that you feel it necessary to drag out irrelevancies and leave the thread you started? you got answers to your questions when you began baiting me, if you recall, after you had made some ridiculous remarks about adrienne regard and, having been corrected, changed the subject with your remarks about having a discussion of substance. if you really wanted a discussion of substance, why then do you disregard logic and substance in order to toss silly accussations, e.g. \"it really doesn't matter to you...\" if it matters to you, then why not define human being and seek some substance? you're not going to convince a logical person of the rightness of your position unless you apply some logic and show some meaning to your words. as others point out, one is sacrificed for the other depending on which has the better chance at survival. again, your analogy fails. not precedence, but possession makes a difference here. a woman's womb is indisputably her own. also, i see you ignore my statement that you would grant rights to a fetus that would not be granted a born human being. was that due to its inconvenience? is it? please cite a precedent and the basis of the ruling. you simply assert things without any support. your analogy is not accurate and your assertions are unsupported. try this on for size. it is not murder for one siamese twin to kill the other in the womb. there. we now have equal arguments. but the idea is illogical. for one siamese twin to kill the other in the womb would likely be to kill itself as well. the systems are dependent on each other for life. i'm still struggling to see anything analagous here and failing to do so. your argument is from fantasy island. your comparison is a total failure, as i have demonstrated already, and has no basis in reality, neither legally nor medically. and for you to assert that it is not a perfect comparison because of the impossible, that of coercion or oppression, is ridiculous. as i said, you give the analogy too little credit for failure. on the one hand you start this by saying you want to take a real, rather than a hypothetical, situation, then you fly off into siamese twins murdering one another in the womb or coercing or oppressing each other in the womb when the reality of the situation you describe in now way matches your version. as i said before, decisions are made regarding which twin lives and dies in situations where they cannot both survive. and, furthermore, as i have already said, there is a difference between an equal claim to organs and a claim that is unequal. you seem to be asserting that a fetus has a claim on a woman's womb. when the fetus is born, what happens to its claim? and by what reason do you assert its claim? you haven't answered the question. the situations are not analagous. again you avoid the question. dependence can be transferred, and it is not as slow as you seem to think. yes, and i'd hate to have been the one to tell dr gunn's children that he was murdered by a religious, \"pro-life\" fanatic. please do try to stay relevant. clever comeback. i congratulate you on the readiness of your wit. what happened to that claim to bodily organs where life is at stake? why does this parent now have an indisputable right to his or her kidney when previously the parent did not, by your standards? what is different about the two situations? i see i have to spell this out for you since the meaning was too subtle for you. in the one case you do not recognize a difference between a fetus and a born child (you ask why a born child cannot be abandoned but a fetus can), and in this case you recognize a significant difference between the fetus and born child where the lives of the two are at stake. you can't have it both ways. action and inaction are irrelevant to the principle, but you are wrong about the inaction anyway. ask any of the numerous women who post here and have borne children how inactive their pregnancy was. to have a healthy, live child, a woman does more than hang out, eat as she chooses, plays volleyball like she always did, drinks at parties with her friends, etc. she behaves very differently, and the provision of her resources to a fetus may be no more voluntary than the beating of her heart, but it is far from inactive.",

            "that's ridiculous! they aren't designed, they evolved. and, much as it discomforts us, in humans a trouble-free birth process was sacrificed to increased brain and cranial size. wild animals have a much easier time with birth than humans do. domestic horses and cows typically have a worse time. to give you an idea: my family tree is complicated because a few of my pioneer great-great- grandfathers had several wives, and we never could figure out which wife had each child. one might ask why this happened. my great-great- grandfathers were, by the time they reached their forties, quite prosperous farmers. nonetheless, they lost several wives each to the rigors of childbirth; the graveyards in spencer, indiana, and boswell, north dakota, contain quite a few gravestones like \"ida, wf. of jacob liptrap, and baby, may 6, 1853.\" more like one in ten. and the consequences can be devastating; i have direct experience of more than a dozen victims of a fouled-up breech birth. it isn't always fatal. but it is often fatal, when it happens out of reach of adequate help. more often, it permanently damages one's health. clearly women's bodies _evolved_ to give birth (i am no believer in divine design); however, evolution did not favor trouble-free births for humans. my, aren't we wroth! i haven't read a more outrageous straw man attack in months! i can practically see your mouth foam. we're statistically sophisticated enough to balance the risks. although i can't produce exact statistics 5 years after the last time we looked them up, rest assured that we balanced c-section risks against other risks. i wouldn't encourage my wife to have a caesarean unless it was clearly indicated; on the other hand, i am opposed (on obvious grounds) to waiting until an emergency to give in. and bear this in mind: my wife took the lead in all of these decisions. we talked things over, and i did a lot of the leg work, but the main decisions were really hers. i don't know of very many home birth advocates, even, that think that a first-time mother should have her baby at home. but people should bother to find out the relative risks. my wife was unwilling to take any significant risks in order to have nice surroundings. in view of the intensity of the birth experience, i doubt surroundings have much importance anyway. somehow the values you're advocating seem all lopsided to me: taking risks, even if fairly small, of serious permanent harm in order to preserve something that is, after all, an esthetic consideration.",
            "ok, doug is right, it would be obstruction of justice, blah blah blah, but, saying \"i forgot\" is a lie, which is just as bad from a moral point of view _if_ you think \"lawfulness\" is a good in and of itself (which admittedly most people do not.) but there's an even better way out of this. provided the government is prosecuting you criminally, you can probably plead the fifth amendmeent and thus legally avoid revealing your key. the government cannot demand information from a criminal defendant which \"may tend to incriminate\" that defendant. though this has never been applied in the cryptography context (at least as far as i can tell) it seems an obvious application to me. this may be a common suggestion in this group, but if it's not (i'm new here) i'd love to hear what people have to say about it. since i don't really read this group (and since the subject matter is more legal than cryptoid) maybe misc.legal.computing would be an appropriate place? steve.",

            "remember roads in america are not designed for speeds above 80 meaning they would be safe at 55-65. roads like the autobahn are smoother, straiter, wider and slightly banked. example: a few months back i was traveling late at night ( 3:00 am or so) and i was changing highways at a bent crosssing. it curved off to the south east becoming hidden by trees after about 1,000 ft and continued to the left strait north. i wanted to turn north, checked the south lane, rolled into the crossing and checked the north lane. nevertheless there wasn't a car in sight, so i took one last look and pulled into the left hand lane. now my car isn't a 5 sec 0-60 performer but i was in the corect lane and over 40 in decent time, even at 3:00 i wasn't wasting time. it was then that i checked my mirror and saw a mustang closing in my lane *fast*, he had just turned the corner and was just noticing me. luckly he saw me and changed lanes in time, i estamate he was moving in excess of 90 or so. i was just a by stander, i had no chance of runing from him, or moving out of his way. i'm glad he saw my brake lights in time. i shudder to think of what would have happened had i wainted to pull out and not left the time he needed to dodge me. rule: just because your car can do 100+, and your way is clear, don't assume it will stay that way.",
            "% %by elias davidsson - april 1991 (revision oct. 1991) note - you are already posting \"facts\", some of which are outdated. the biased presentation of facts, as well as the conclusions that you reach leave me little hope of engaging in any fruitful exchange that might lead to a \"meeting of the minds\". it is to those who read with open mind, that i address myself. %the international convention on the elimination of all forms of %racial discrimination adopted by the general assembly of the %united nations in 1965, has now been ratified by most member %states. article 1 of this convention defines the term racial %discrimination as \"any distinction, exclusion, restriction or %preference based on race, colour, descent, or national or ethnic %origin which has the purpose or effect of nullifying or impairing %the recognition, enjoyment or exercise, on an equal footing, of %human rights and fundamental freedoms in the political, economic, %social, cultural or any other field of public life.\" while the ideals embodied in this text are worthy goals, as the text currently stands i know of no country in which racial discrimination of some sort can not be found. it makes no mention of the need for for a legislative violation. %the general assembly endorsed in 1975 a resolution defining %zionism as a form of racism and racial discrimination. the %important, correct and legitimate resolution is incomplete since %it does not include operative statements designed to end israeli %racial discrimination. meanwhile the united states, on behalf of %israel, are exerting heavy pressure on member states of the united %nations to repeal this resolution and give israeli racial %practices - zionism - moral legitimacy. if you are, in principle, advocating un intervention via operative statements in this case, it must therefore hold that they can be applied to any other case where the council perceives some form of racial discrimination as previously exhibited. scarey thought. %the very definition of israel as a state belonging to the jews of %the world (but not to its inhabitants), alienates all native %non-jews born in that country. actually, i know quite a few native non-jews born in israel that are not alienated by this law. if you had said some, you would probably be correct, however your tendency to exagerate and slant facts becomes apparent. this slant permeates the text. %practically all non-jews who are living in or originate from areas %under israeli control, identify themselves as palestinians. most %of them are muslim, many are christian. a few jews, including the %author of these lines, also identify themselves as palestinians. the above statement is not true. practically all - discounting beduins, circassians, druze, and some other fringe groups. your own identification is a matter that has no bearing upon the issue. you could equally identify yourself as a [insert group]. %zionism took off in europe at the end of last century. it's aim %was to create a jewish state in palestine in spite of the adamant %opposition of palestinian arabs (95% of the population). if i recall correctly, at the time \"zionism\" took off, there was no adamant opposition in palestine. i am open to any factual contradictory evidence . %but the %zionists were more powerful, militarily, economically and %technologically, and succeeded in 1948 in conquering 70% of the %area of mandatory palestine. after driving into exile most native %arabs from the conquered areas, approximately 750,000 people, and %razing most of their villages to the ground, the zionists could %finally establish a predominantly jewish state. only 150,000 %non-jews remained on israeli territory. do you therefore contend that the 400 villages you mention further on \"most of their villages\"? %once the jewish state was established, it began enacting laws to %help the confiscation of land from native non-jews, their %political repression and their destitution. there is no doubt that laws passed provided a framework which was later used for these purposes. however, you seem to imply that this was the intention a priori, which implies a policy and agenda. my knowledge was that this was not the case. you also neglect to mention the circumstances that surrounded this. as you do again, below. %in 1967 the state of israel invaded egypt and syria and occupied %the rest of palestine (the west bank and the gaza strip). thus %another 1.5 million palestinians fell under its juridiction. its %occupation of palestinian and other arab territories is considered %illegal by the international community, as reflected in security %council resolutions. israel has rejected all u.n. resolutions and %began without delay to entrench its occupation and rule over these %territories with the aim of annexing them at the appropriate time. not quite accurate. israel has not rejected all the resolutions, though it has conflicting understanding with regards to some of them. israel never annexed the sinai, west bank, or gaza. the other annexations were brought about partly due to the un resolutions. %part of these territores, east jerusalem and the golan heights, %have already been forcefully annexed by israel, in defiance of %international law and un resolutions. out of curiousity, provided that the annexees are granted citizenship, what int'l law do you claim prohibits annexation of territories captured in war? has this ever been applied to any other country previously (other than iraq) ? %it must be emphasized that, although these people live under %different regimes, they are united in their self-perception as %palestinians, that is as people identifying with palestine, a %territorial entity (not an ethnic or religious entity). incorrect! palestinians themselves claim to be discriminated against on an \"ethnic or racial\" basis. therefore your above statement is incorrect. i also note that given the previous definition of racial discrimination, the only means that you could argue for that is nationalistically. however, no such nation has existed. it definitely did not exist at the time of the creation of israel, in which case you can not argue racial discrimination during that period! %furthermore palestinians generally consider the plo both as a %symbol of national identity and as the unchallenged authority that %represents them in world affairs. once again, some do, some don't. %the non-jewish population living in the palestinian and other arab %territories occupied by israel in 1967 suffers not only blatant %discrimination but is subject to brutal military occupation. another generalization, but then again, you don't seem to care about anyone other than the palestinian people, whose cause you espouse. %licence, to start a business and to buy industrial equipment, the %right to educate children, all of these basic rights are subject %to arbitrary rulings by military authorities and cannot be %challenged in court. incorrect once again. they have the ability to appeal. furthermore, although you may not agree with them, not all of the military rulings are senseless or arbitrary. some are, but this is not due to the \"whims\" of the military as much as the sizeof the task/organization. %only jewish inhabitants of the occupied %territories are permitted to carry firearms. incorrect once again. i know two arab policemen who lived in daheisha and there were more. of course, with the outbreak of the intifada they were forced by the locals to resign, bitterly. %jewish settlers have %right to 6-7 more water per person than non-jews. jewish residents %of these territories number now about 100,000 people. it is israel %governmentus policy to increase this number substantially, in %total defiance of international law, un resolutions and the will %of the population. the state of israel systematically confiscates %land from non-jewish inhabitants of these territories for jewish %settlement. that is no longer true, and i can't help but wonder what your purpose is/was in posting this. %some 800,000 people in israel proper,are not jews. most of them %consider themselves palestinians with israeli citizenship. for %many years after the establishment of israel they were subjected %to harsh military control. much of their land was confiscated by %the state and handed to jewish organisations for exclusive jewish %settlement. they have been subject to massacres, destitution and %humiliation. while they enjoy, with jewish israelis, the right to %vote, they are discriminated against both through law and in %practice. once again, to hell with the other minorities that don't fit in, right? their are many villages who did not suffer in the way you seem to indicate, abu gosh comes to mind. yes, some did but as a result of what actions? %approximately 92% of the surface of the state of israel within the %rgreen lines is for all purposes closed to palestinians who are %second-class citizens in israel. they may neither legally live on %such land, nor rent or cultivate it. a direct effect of these %policies is that native non-jewish citizens of israel are denied %residence and membership rights in most rural communities in %israel, including the collective settlements, kibbutzim. non-jews %are discriminated against in many other ways: the government %starves local authorities of palestinian villages and townships of %funds; jewish city councils force palestinians to live in ghettos; %jewish families receive higher child allocations than their %non-jewish neighbors, palestinian schools suffer underfunding and %understaffing (as compared to jewish schools); palestinian %children are denied the right to learn their history and %literature; israelis who struggle for equal rights and for the end %of racial discrimination, suffer continuous harassment by the %authorities. 1. there are some kibbutzim with arab/non-jewish members. it is up to the members of the kibbutz. there is no legislation against it, nor against a purely non-jewish collective. 2. funds are the result of political lobbying. bearing in mind that non_jews compose ~20% of the voting population, it has never failed to amaze me that they fail to form one large bloc, and increase their power. the recent elections are a case in point. 3. please provide factual evidence supporting your allegation with regard to educational material. you have obviously never seen the curriculum of a school in the west bank. it is based upon jordan's school system. 4. with regard to your last statement, it is simply another gross generalization. %the state of israel refuses to acknowledge itself as the state of %all its inhabitants. although the israeli cabinet has never %openly endorsed the 'transfer' idea (the forced removal from the %country of its native palestinian population, that is, its %ultimate judaization), israeli government policies towards %non-jews bear the mark of this 'final solution'. no attempt is %made by the zionist authorities to integrate palestinian arabs %into israeli public life. thus, although comprising approximately %17% of the population of israeli citizens, no palestinian citizen %of israel has ever served as cabinet member, as director of %ministry or of a national institution, as judge of the supreme %court, as ambassador of israel, or in any leading position in %israeli economic or financial life. even the director of the %ministry for arab affairs - yes, such a thing exists! - is a jew. another generalization, but lets not stop here. the transfer idea was espoused by one party in the last gov't, moledet. it was intended to be a solution to the problem in the territories, not the country itself. with regard to other items, i recall at least one arab ambassador, and the rest was covered previously. %although sexual %relations between and cohabitation of jews and non-jews are legal, %they are considered by israeli/zionist society somewhat a betrayal %of the jewish and zionist ethics. the israeli educational system %nurtures this attitude in a systematic way. when was the last time you were in israel? that is simply not true, nor has it been for quite some time. the question of religious intervention is best answered by the proportional representation and the lack of any arab party bloc to counter the orthodox one. %zionism rejects the idea of a modern secular state, based on %equality of all citizens. this is one main reason why israel has %not produced any written constitution. simply incorrect. the answer is political. once again, your failure to understand the dynamics and movements inside israeli gov't, relegates your contentions to the sidelines. %zionism predicates a state %where jews have privileged rights. thus, according to israeli law, %a jew born in london, who has never visited israel, does not speak %hebrew and professes atheism, is granted automatic israeli %citizenship, while native palestinian inhabitants who happen to be %christian or muslim, are treated almost as aliens. racial %discrimination, as defined in international law, is thus not only %reflected in israeli laws and policies, but is grounded in the %very nature of israel as a jewish state. but the discrimination is not based upon race. oops, sorry, nasty habit i have of countering malicious false truths. %any proposal for israeli-arab and israeli-palestinian peace that %does not address the issue of racial discrimination by israel - %that is the zionist nature of the state of israel - is thus doomed %to fail. real world intrusion - any proposal that does is doomed to fail. of course, i wouldn't expect you to understand, wrapped up as you are in your view of things. let's not let anything penetrate shall we!?! i may be a bit too sarcastic but there is a limit to the amount of patience i have for rubbish at 02:00.",

(and then again maybe not by now :-) i proceed: let's start with the name \"rosicrucian\". i took me a long time to come to the conclusion that there is a difference between a *member* of a \"rosicrucian\" body and being *a* rosicrucian. so when you say that you met some 'rosicrucians' you mean \"members of a group that calls themselves rosicrucian\". at least that is what your observation suggests :-) i'd prefer if you would have stated up front that it was the lectorium rosicrucianum, only because they may be confused, by some readers of this newsgroup, with the rosicrucian order amorc based (the usa jurisdiction) in san jose, ca; this being the rc org with the most members (last time i looked). of course, \"most members\" does not *necessarily* mean \"best\". anyway, the lectorium rosicrucianum claims they descend (at least in part) from what was the \"gold-und-rosenkreuz\" (golden and rosy cross), from the 18th century. there were two \"golden and rosy cross\", the first (chronologically) more alchemical, the second with masonic tinges, but their history is the subject of a complete chapter :-). \"you'll have to trust me\" when i tell you that if that lecture/class/whatever had been presented by amorc, it is unlikely that you would have had the same impression, i.e., you'd probably have had a positive impression more likely than a negative one, imho. again, instead of r:s, it should be \"lectorium rosicrucianum\" :-). it is curious to know that 3 other rc 'orders' (in the usa) claim to be *non- sectarian*. the cathars were a 'heretic' christian sect that directly challenged the 'authority' of the medieval catholic church. they flourished during the 12th century, century which saw the religious zeal expressed in the crusades and also the growing disillusion with the catholic church and the worldly ways of its clerics. it was largely in response to the church's unseemly pomp and splendor that catharism took root, first in northern italy, then throughout the south of france. i don't see nothing *fundamentally* wrong with \"us containing something divine\"... and yes i don't like phrases like \"eternal bliss\" either! :-) for a moment i thought you were referring to madison ave :-) (madison avenue in new york city is where the most influential (read $$$) *commercial* advertising is produced here in the usa :-) peace, tony",

(session keys are negotiated, but knowing the private key is believed by many commentators here to break the security. no doubt more details will emerge.) so, the loss of a key, whether one is guilty or innocent, may mean a lot more than merely replacing the phone. sort of like saying to someone, \"oh, i copied your diary. but i'll buy you a new one.\" and the system, if made mandatory (as i expect), will make such storing of conversations much easier, i fear. for one thing, the transmission of the escrow key field acts as a clear signal to anyone listening, a kind of \"caller id\" and \"callee id\" on a grand scale. also, the phone companies may not care as much about protecting the privacy of the calls, as they perceive them all to be useless encrypted junk.

            "this question came up in sci. med. nutrition and i'm posting my answer here. only 22 medical schools in the u.s. teach courses on human nutrition. we have already seen what a lack of nutrition education can do when candida and kidney stones present themselves to the medical community. i think that the best example of where u.s. medicine is really missing the mark when it comes to a knowledge of nutrition is pms. so many women(and their husbands) suffer from this disorder that it is really criminal that most physicians in the u.s. are not taught that pms is primarily caused by diet and diet changes can prevent it from ever happpening. before shooting your flames, read the entire article and then decide if flaming is justified. from a poster in sci. medi. nutrition: side-tracked with candida. pms is a lot like candida blooms, most physicians don't recognize it as a specific \"disease\" entity. here is everything that you would ever want to know about pms. premenstrual syndrome has been divided into four specific subgroups: pmt-a(anxiety) pmt-d(depression) anxiety depression irritability forgetfulness insomnia confusion depression lethargy pmt-c(craving) pmt-h(hyperhydration) craving for sweets weight gain increased appetite breast congestion and tenderness sugar ingestion causes: abdominal bloating and tenderness 1. headache edema of the face and extremities 2. palpitations 3. fatigue or fainting pmt-a is characterized by elevated blood estrogen levels and low progesterone levels during the luteal phase of a women's cycle. pmt-c is caused by the ingestion of large amounts of refined simple carbohydrates. during the luteal phase of a women's cycle, there is increased glucose tolerance with a flat glucose curve after oral glucose challenge. the metabolic findings believed to be responsible for pmt-c are a low magnesium and a low prostaglandin e1. this condition of hypoglycemia is not unique to pms but there are a number of different causes of hypoglycemia, magnesium and pge1 seem to be specific to pms hypoglycemia. a. am. j. psychiatry 147(4):477-80(1990). unrefined complex carbohydrate should be substituted for sugar, magnesium supplementation and alpha linoleic acid supplementation(increased to 5-6% of the total calories) using safflower oil or evening primrose oil as sources of alpha linoleic acid. pmt-d is characterized by elevated progesterone levels during the midluteal phase of a women's cycle. another cause of pmt-d has been found to be lead toxicity(in women without elevated progesterone levels during the midluteal phase). \"effect of metal ions on the binding of estridol to human endometrial cystol\" fertil. steril. 28:312-18(1972). pmt-h is associated with water and salt retention along with an elevated serum aldosterone level. salt restriction, b6, magnesium and vitamin e for breast tenderness have all been effective in treating pmt-h this general discussion of the pms syndromes came form: a. \"management of the premenstrual tension sundromes: rational for a nutritional approach\". 1986, a year in nutritional medicine. j. bland, ed. keats, publishing, 1986. b. \"nutritional factors in the etiology of premenstrual tension syndromes\", j. reprod. med.28(7):446-64(1983). c. \"premenstrual tension\", prob. obstet. gynecol. 3(12):1-39(1980) treatment has traditionally involved progesterone administration if you can find a doctor who will treat you for pms(just about as hard as finding one that will treat you for candida blooms). while progesterone will work, supplementation with vitamins and minerals works even better. there really has been an awful lot of research done on pms(much more than candida blooms). many of these studies have been what are called experimental controlled studies(the type of rigorous clinical studies that doctors like to see done). here are a few of these studies: carbohydrate: experimental controlled study, \"effect of a low-fat, high-carbohydrate diet on symptoms of cyclical mastopathy\" lancet 2:128-32(1988). 21 pts with severe persistent cyclical mastopathy of at least 5 years duration were randomly selected to receive specific training to reduce dietary fat to 15% of total calories and increase complex carbohydrate ingestion or given general dietary advise with no training. after 6 months, there was a significant reduction in the severity of the breast swelling and tenderness in the trained group as reported by self-reported symptoms as well as physical exams which quantitated the degree of breast swelling, tenderness and nodularity. vitamin a: experimental controlled study, \"the use of vitamin a in premenstrual tension\" acta obstet. gynecol scand. 39:586-92(1960). 218 pts with severe recurring pms received 200,000 to 300,000iu vitamin a daily or a placebo. serum retinol levels were monitored and high dose supplementation was discontinued when evidence of toxicity occured(serum retinol above 450ug/ml). the intent of the study was to load the liver up with vitamin a and get a normal pool size(500,000iu to 1,000,000iu) and then see if this normal vitamin a pool could prevent pms. 48% getting the high dose vitamin a had complete remission of the symptoms of pms. only 10% getting the placebo reported getting complete relief of pms sysmptoms. 10% of the vitamin a treated group reported no improvement in pms symptoms. experimental controlled study, \"premenstrual tension treated with vitamin a\" j. clinical endocrinology 10:1579-89(1950). 30 pts received 200,000iu of vitamin a daily starting on day 15 of their cycle with supplementation continuing until the onset of pms symptoms. after 2-6 months, all 30 pts reported a significant improvement in pms symptoms. vitamin a supplementation was stopped once evidence of toxicity was demonstrated and all 30 pts were followed for one year after high dose vitamin a supplementation was stopped. pms symptoms did not reoccur in any of these 30 pts for upto one year after the vitamin a supplementation was stopped. most americans do not have a normal store of vitamin a in their liver. these studies and several others were designed to see if getting a normal store of vitamin a into the liver could eliminate pms. of all the vitamins given for pms(vitamin a, b6, and vitamin e), vitamin a has shown the best single effect. this is probably because vitamin a is involved in steroid (estrogen/progesterone) metabolism in the liver. getting your liver full of vitamin a seems to be one of the best things that you can do to prevent the symptoms of pms. but vitamin a is toxic and you don't want to be trying to do this without being seen by a physician who can monitor you for vitamin a toxicity. vitamin b6: experimental double-blind crossoverr study, \"pyridoxine (vitamin b6) and the premenstrual syndrome: a randomized crossover trial\"j.r. coll. gen. pract. 39:364-68(1989). 32 women aged 18-49 with moderate to severe pms randomly received 50mg b6 daily or placebo. after 3 months the groups were switched and followed for another 3 months. b6 had a significant effect on the emotional aspects of pms(depression, irritability and tiredness). other symptoms of pms were not significanttly affected by b6 supplementation. experimental double-blind study, \"the efects of vitamin b6 supplementation on premenstrual sysmptoms\" obstet. gynecol 70(2):145-49(1987). 55 pts with moderate to severe pms received 150mg b6 daily or placebo for 2 months. analysis of convergence showed that b6 significantly improved premenstrual symptoms related to the autonomic nervous system(dizziness and vomiting) as well as behavior changes(poor mental performance, decreased social interaction) anxiety, depression and water retention were not improved by b6 supplementation. vitamin b6 is below the rda for both american men and women. birth control pills and over 40 different drugs increase the b6 requirement in man. women on birth control pills should be supplemented with 10-15 mg of b6 per day. the dose should be increased if symptoms of pms appear. dr. david r. rubinow who heads the biological psychiatry branch of nimh was quoted in clin. psychiatry news, december, 1987 as stating that b6 should be considered the \"first-line\" drug for pms(over progesterone) and if the patient does not respond, then other treatments should be tried. vitamin b6 can be toxic(nerve damage) if consumed in doses of 500mg or more each day. vitamin e: experimental double-blind study, \"efficacy of alpha- tocopherol in the treatment of premenstrual syndrome\" j. reprod. med. 32(6):400-04(1987). 35 pts received 400iu vitamin e daily for 3 cycles or a placebo. vitamin e treated pts had 33% who reported a significant reduction in physical symptoms(weight gain and breast tenderness) while the placebo group had 14% who reported a significant reduction in physical symptoms. the vitamin e group reported that 38% had a significant reduction in anxiety versus 12% for the placebo group. for depression, the vitamin e group had 27% with a significant decrease in depression compared with 8% for the placebo group. experimental double-blind study, \"the effect of alpha-tocopherol on premenstrual symptomalogy: a double blind study\" j. am. coll. nutr. 2(2):115-122(1983). 75pts with benign breast disease and pmt randomly received vitamin e at 75iu, 150iu, or 300iu daily or placebo. after 2 months of supplementation, 150iu of vitamin e or higher significantly improved pmt-a and pmt-c. the 300iu dose was needed to significantly improve pmt-d. no dose of vitamin e significantly improved pmt-h (other studies have shown that a higher vitamin e doses will relieve pmt-h symptoms). magnesium: experimental double-blind study, \"magnesium prophylaxis of menstrual migraine: effects on itracellular magnesium\" headache 31:298-304(1991). 20 pts with perimenstrual headache received 360 mg daily of magnesium as magnesium pyrrolidone carboxylic acid or a placebo. treatment was started on the 15th day of the cycle and continued until menstruation. after 2 months, the pain total index was significantly lower in the magnesium group. magnesium treatment was also assocoiated with a significant reduction in the menstrual distress questionnaire scores. pretreatment magnesium levels in lymphocytes and polymorphonuclear leukocytes were significantly lower in this group of 20 pts compared to control women who did not suffer from pms. after treatment, magnesium levels in these cells was raised into the normal range. experimental double-blind study, \"oral magnesium successfully relieves premenstrual mood changes\" obstet. gynecol 78(2):177-81(1991). 32pts aged 24-39 randomly received either magnesium carboxylic acid 360mg of mg per day or a placebo from the 15th day of the cycle to the onset of the menstrual flow. after 2 cycles, both groups received magnesium. the menstrual distress questionnaire score of the cluster pain was significantly reduced during the second cycle(month) for the magnesium treatment group as well as the placebo group once they were switched to magnesium supplementation. in addition, the total score on the menstrual distress questionnaire was significantly decreased by magnesium supplementation. the authors suggest that magnesium supplemenation should become a routine treatment for the mood changes that occur during pms. there are numerous observational studies that have been published in the medical literature which also suggest that pms is primarily a disorder that arises out of a hormone imbalance that is dietary in nature. but since observational studies are considered by most physicians in sci. med. to be anecdotal in nature, i have not bothered to cite them. there are also over a half dozen good experimental studies that have been done on multivitamin and mineral supplementation to prevent pms. i've chosen the best specific studies on individual vitamins and minerals to try to point out that pms is primarily a nutritional disorder. but doctors don't recognize nutritional disorders unless they can see clinical pathology(beri-beri, pellagra, scruvy, etc.). pms is probably the best reason why every doctor being trained in the u.s. should get a good course on human nutrition. pms is really only the tip if the iceberg when it comes to nutritional disorders. it's time that medicine woke up and smelled the roses. here's some studies which show the importance in multivitamin/mineral supplementation and/or diet change in preventing pms. experimental study, \"effect of a nutritional programme on premenstrual syndrome: a retrospective analysis\", complement. med. res.5(1):8-11(1991). 200pts were given dietary instructions and supplemented with optivite(r) plus additional vitamin c, vitamin e, magnesium, zinc and primrose oil. the dietary instructions were to take the supplements and switch to a low fat, complex carbohydrate diet. on a retrospective analysis, 96.5% of the 200pts reported an improvement in their pms symptoms with 30% of the sample stating that they no longer suffered from pms. experimental double-blind study, \"role of nutrition in managing premenstrual tension syndromes\", j reprod. med. 32(6):405-22(1987). a low fat, high complex carbohydrate diet along with optivite supplementation significantly decreased pms scores compared with diet change and placebo. after 6 months on the experimental program, the vitamin/mineral supplementated group had significantly decreased estradiol and increased progesterone in serum during the midlutel phase of their cycle. experimental double-blind study, \"clinical and biochemical effects of nutritional supplementation on the premenstrual syndrome\", j. reprod. med. 32(6):435-41(1987). 119pts randomly given optivite(12 tablets per day) or a placebo. the treated groups showed a significant decrease in pms symptoms compared to the placebo. another group of 104pts got optivite(4 tablets per day) or placebo. for this second group of patients, no significant effect of supplementation on pms symptoms was observed.

            "los angeles times, tuesday, april 13, 1993. p. a1. new details of extensive adl spy operation emerge * inquiry: transcripts reveal nearly 40 years of espionage by a man who infiltrated political groups by richard c. paddock, times staff writer. san francisco -- to the outside world, roy bullock was a small-time art dealer who operated from his house in the castro district. in reality, he was an undercover spy who picked through garbage and amassed secret files for the anti-defamation league for nearly 40 years. his code name at the prominent jewish organization was cal, and he was so successful at infiltrating political groups that he was once chosen to head an arab-american delegation that visited rep. nancy pelosi (d-san francisco) in her washington, d.c., office. for a time, cal tapped into the phone message system of the white aryan resistance to learn of hate crimes. from police sources he obtained privileged, personal information on at least 1,394 people. and he met surreptitiously with agents of the south african government to trade his knowledge for crisp, new $100 bills. these are among the secrets that bullock and david gurvitz, a former los angeles-based operative, divulged in extensive interviews with police and the fbi in a growing scandal over the nation-wide intelligence network operated by the anti-defamation league. officials of the anti-defamation league, while denying any improper activity, have said they will cooperate with the investigation. they have refused to discuss bullock and gurvitz. transcripts of the interviews -- among nearly 700 pages of documents released by san francisco prosecutors last week -- offer new details of the private spy operation that authorities allege crossed the line into illegal territory. at times, the intelligence activities took on a cloak-and-dagger air with laundered payments, shredded documents, hotel rendezvous with foreign agents and code names like \"ironsides\" and \"flipper.\" on one occasion, gurvitz recounts, he received a tip that a pro-palestinian activist was about to board a plane bound for haifa, israel. although the anti-defamation league publicly denies any ties to israel, gurvitz phoned an israeli consular official to warn him. shortly afterward, another official called gurvitz back and debriefed him. the court papers also added to the mystery of tom gerard, a former cia agent and san francisco police officer accused of providing confidential material from police files to the anti-defamation league. gerard fled to the philippines last fall after he was interviewed by the fbi, but left behind a briefcase in his police locker. its contents included passports, driver's licenses and identification cards in 10 different names; identification cards in his own name for four american embassies in central america; and a collection of blank birth certificates, army discharge papers and official stationery from various agencies. also in the briefcase were extensive information on death squads, a black hood, apparently for use in interrogations, and photos of blindfolded and chained men. investigators suspect that gerard and other police sources gave the adl confidential driver's license or vehicle registration information on a vast number of people, including as many as 4,500 members of one target group, the arab-american anti-discrimination committee. each case of obtaining such data from a law enforcement officer would constitute a felony, san francisco police inspector ron roth noted in an affidavit for a search warrant. the anti-defamation league, a self-described jewish defense and civil rights organization, acknowledges it has long collected information on groups that are anti-semitic, extremist or racist. the adl's fact-finding division, headed by irwinn suall in new york, enjoys a reputation for thoroughness and has often shared its information with police agencies and journalists. however, evidence seized from bullock's computer shows he kept files on at least 950 groups of all political stripes, including the american civil liberties union, earth island institute, the united farm workers, jews for jesus, mother jones magazine, the center for investigative reporting, the bo gritz for president committee, the asian law caucus and the aids activist group act up. the computer files also included information on several members of congress, including pelosi, house armed services committee chairman ron dellums (d-berkeley) and former republican rep. pete mccloskey from the bay area. in their statements, bullock and gurvitz said the anti-defamation league has collected information on political activists in the los angeles area for more than 30 years. they said they worked closely with three los angeles county sheriff's deputies who specialized in intelligence work, a los angeles police department anti-terrorism expert and a san diego county sheriff's department intelligence officer. a spokesman for the los angeles sheriff's department said he knew nothing of any contact between the deputies and the adl. the los angeles police department, which earlier refused to cooperate with the investigation, and the san diego sheriff's department declined comment. bullock, 58, is one of the most intriguing characters in the spy drama. although he is not jewish, he began working undercover as a volunteer for the adl and the fbi in indiana in 1954 after reading a book about a man who infiltrated the communist party. bullock moved to los angeles in 1960 and was given a paid position by the adl as an intelligence operative, he told authorities. in the mid-1970s, he moved to san francisco and continued his spy operations up and down the west coast. to keep his identity secret, his salary has always been funneled through beverly hills attorney bruce i. hochman -- who has never missed a payment in more than 32 years, bullock said. \"i was an investigator for the adl. i investigated any and all anti-democratic movements,\" bullock said. \". . . officially, i'm only a contract worker with bruce hochman. that way, the league would not be officially connected with me.\" bullock said he became a master at infiltrating groups from communists to arab-american to gay radicals to skinheads, usually using his own name but once adopting the alias elmer fink. \"i'm one of a kind,\" he told police. in recent years, however, his adl affiliation has increasingly become known, and at one point he was confronted by a skinhead armed with a shotgun who threatened to kill him. in the mid-1980s, he helped san francisco police solve a bombing at a synagogue by combing through the trash of extremist cory phelps and matching handwriting with samples on a threatening letter obtained by police. in part because of this investigation, he became close friends with gerard, who at the time was working in the san francisco police intelligence division. bullock frequently searched through the garbage of target groups. an fbi report noted how he investigated one palestinian group: \"bullock would write reports based on what he found in the trash, and would share the reports with gerard. bullock also gave the trash to gerard for gerard to examine. gerard would later return the trash to bullock.\" from a wide range of sources, bullock compiled files on 9,876 individuals and more than 950 political groups. gerard, whose files contained many identical entries, kept files on 7,011 people. in 1987, bullock and gerard began selling some of their vast wealth of information to the south african government. bullock tells of meetings secretly with south african agents at san francisco hotels and receiving envelopes filled with thousands of dollars in new $100 bills. bullock insists the information he sold consisted of data he culled only from public sources. once he rewrote an innocuous item published by san francisco chronicle columnist herb caen about south african bishop desmond tutu and the wife of prominent attorney melvin belli -- and submitted it as his own work. bullock said it was gerard who sold official police intelligence. bullock said he split about $16,000 from the south african government evenly with gerard, telling him at one point, \"i may be gay but i'm a straight arrow.\" in his interviews with the police and fbi, bullock talked freely about engaging in certain activities that prosecutors say would appear to violate the law. for example, bullock admitted to receiving driver's license records and criminal histories from gerard on about 50 people -- a fraction of the confidential police data found in his computer. and he said gerard gave him complete san francisco police department intelligence files on various nazi groups that were supposed to be destroyed under department policy. bullock said he also received a confidential fbi report on the nation of islam that he later shredded at the anti-defamation league's san francisco office. bullock seemed proud of his \"operation eavesdrop,\" in which he used a paid informant, code-named scumbag, to help tap into a white aryan resistance phone message network, listening to the messages left by members of the right-wing group. \"for a short time, it was wonderful,\" he told police. in los angeles, adl operative gurvitz was hired about four years ago as a \"fact-finder\" to keep intelligence files and occasionally go undercover to the meetings of target groups. among other things, he told san francisco authorities, the los angeles adl office kept a record of any arab-american who had \"anti-israel leanings\" or who wrote a letter to a newspaper expressing such sentiment. gurvitz was recently forced to resign after an incident in which he attempted to misuse the adl intelligence network to seek revenge on a rival who got a job gurvitz wanted at the simon wiesenthal center for holocaust studies. gurvitz got confidential police data on the rival and threatened to expose him as a jewish spy to a right-wing hate group. gurvitz has since begun cooperating with police and the fbi in the probe, providing considerable information about the adl operation. unlike bullock, he has been assured he is not a subject of the investigation. gurvitz declined through his father in los angeles to be interviewed by the times. bullock's attorney said his client would not comment.",

(see, if someone just plays with the bike without intention of stealing it, at least some eyes are on it, and if they get too rambunctious, they'll set off the alarm.) that's for a nice bike. for a ratbike, the trick is to always keep its actual value well below blue-book, so that it looks so crappy nobody would want to steal it, and even if they were stupid enough to, you would make a profit on the deal. :-) seriously, if i (for instance) need to go on a business trip for a week, and (sadly) have to leave the bikes sitting, they both get a shitty-looking, but useable cover, locked on, and both bikes locked to each other and a curb bumper in the parking lot under the light. i usually rig the cable locks i use (aircraft cable) so that if anyone pulls on either bike or the cable joining them, the concours alarm goes off. and i have a friend come buy every day to have a look and make sure they're still there. the only thing i have ever had stolen was a $60 cover, and that was over winter storage, with the battery out of the bike (and thus no alarm). oh, put your own eyelets into the cover for the locks to pass through, and place them so that they have to absolutely destroy the cover to get it off. that's the best that i can think of. most of the locks i see people put on bikes look, well, not too mechanically sound. i like abus, since i have personally removed master locks from lockers with my boot.",

            "easy vs. hard .....easy on who? i had a rare very personal talk with my mother last year. she said that when she and my father were raising we four children, they did not try to raise us in this world as strictly as they were raised in their norwegian lutheran community. they felt that we would be alienated from them and it would create problems. in other words, my parent did the very tolerant, loving thing. they raised us without conflict, without what we saw as unreasonable demands and were always accepting, no matter what the circumstances. what happened was that i grew up believing in situation ethics and never absolutes. i believed in a loving god, and my concept of god never involved justice or punishment, nor was there any concept that i may someday be held responsible for the things that offended him...sins that the \"world\" told me were ok. my parents are very good, honest and moral people. they raised four extremely honest children. yet, before coming to a more complete knowledge of god (which includes the knowledge of justice and punishment)i committed what i now believe to be many, many grave sins. i lived with a partner outside of marriage, was married and divorced ( only after physical abuse and no apparent hope for change...but i shouldn't have married to person in the first place ) and more.... my parents felt they were doing the loving,kind thing by allowing us to be who we were, by not imposing their standards on us, and by accepting unquestioningly everything we did without judgement or counsel. today, it is absolutely appalling for me to look back on what they *did* accept without a word. it takes courages to dare to help souls because you must speak up and say what is unpopular and difficult and what people do not want to hear. you must be able to say what is hard, and say it as christ would, with love and compassion. it involves risk....perhaps someone you love may not want to hear and will stay away from you. this life is \"but dust\". as long as the comfort of this life is our highest priority, we will fail god and fail those with whom we come in contact. i wonder how many who engage in sex outside of marriage, who support the \"right\" to abortion, who engage in homosexuality, or who commit any of the range of sins that are plentiful in this time have ever heard from a quiet, thoughtful, loving friend that these things are *wrong*. no one ever told me that what i was doing was wrong, and i saw multitudes around me living the same way i was and they seemed like good, decent people. (wouldn't kick dogs or beat the elderly or babies..) it is more difficult for sinners without a genuine prayer life to hear the holy spirit than it is to hear a loving friend. think about this the next time the holy spirit tells you that a friend is in error, but you don't want to \"cause trouble\". righteous prayers is great power, but don't forget that we are we are christ's lips and hands on earth. don't be afraid to simply voice truth when the situation calls for it. say a fervent prayer and ask the holy spirit for love and guidance. in more ways than we may realize, we *are* our brother's keeper.",

x j; <-- don't use such implicit type declaration x int k; x x we suggest that you compile your entry with an ansi c compiler. if you x must use non-ansi c, such as k&r c, you must avoid areas that result in x compile/link errors for ansi c compilers. x x unfortunately, ansi c requires array indexes to be of integral type. x thus, the following classical obfuscation hacks are no longer allowed: x x int i; x char *c; x i[c]; <--- use c[i] instead x (i+3)[\"string\"]; <--- use \"string\"[i+3] instead x x if your entry uses functions that have a variable number of x arguments, be careful. systems implement va_list as a wide variety x of ways. because of this, a number of operations using va_list are x not portable and must not be used: x x * assigning a non-va_list variable to/from a va_list variable x * casting a non-va_list variable into/from a va_list variable x * passing a va_list variable to a function expecting a non-va_list arg x * passing a non-va_list variable to a function expecting a va_list arg x * performing arithmetic on va_list variables x * using va_list as a structure or union x x in particular, do not treat va_list variables as if they were a char **'s. x x avoid using <varargs.h>, use <stdarg.h> instead. x x if you use c preprocessor directives (#define, #if, #ifdef, ...), x the leading '#' must be the first character on a line. while some x c preprocessors allow whitespace the leading '#', many do not. x x because the exit() function returns void on some systems, entries x must not assume that it returns an int. x x small programs are best when they are short, obscure and concise. x while such programs are not as complex as other winners, they do x serve a useful purpose. they are often the only program that people x attempt to completely understand. for this reason, we look for x programs that are compact, and are instructional. x x one line programs should be short one line programs, say around 80 x bytes long. getting close to 160 bytes is a bit too long in our opinion. x x we tend to dislike programs that: x x * are very hardware specific x * are very os or un*x version specific x (index/strchr differences are ok, but socket/streams specific x code is likely not to be) x * dump core or have compiler warnings x (it is ok only if you warn us in the 'remark' header item) x * won't compile under both bsd or sys v un*x x * abusing the build file to get around the size limit x * obfuscate by excessive use of ansi tri-graphs x * are longer than they need to be x * are similar to previous winners x * are identical to previous losers :-) x x unless you are cramped for space, or unless you are entering the x 'best one liner' category, we suggest that you format your program x in a more creative way than simply forming excessively long lines. x x the build file should not be used to try and get around the size x limit. it is one thing to make use of a several -d's to help out, x but it is quite another to use 200+ bytes of -d's in order to x try and squeeze the source under the size limit. you should feel x free to make use of the build file space, but you are better off x if you show some amount of restraint. x x we allowed whitespace, and in certain cases ; { or } do not impact x your program size (up to a certain point), because we want to get x away from source that is simply a compact blob of characters. x x given two versions of the same program, one that is a compact blob x of code, and the other that is formatted more like a typical c x program, we tend to favor the second version. of course, a third x version of the same program that is formatted in an interesting x and/or obfuscated way, would definitely win over the first two! x x we suggest that you avoid trying for the 'smallest self-replicating' x program. we are amazed at the many different sizes that claim x to be the smallest. there is nothing wrong with self-replicating x programs. in fact, a number of winners have been self-replicating. x you might want to avoid the claim of 'smallest', lest we (or others) x know of a smaller one! x x x client entries should be as portable as possible. entries that x adapt to a wide collection of environments will be favored. don't x depend on a particular type of display. for example, don't depend x on color or a given size. don't require backing store. x x x client entries should avoid using x related libraries and x software that is not in wide spread use. we ask that such x client x entries restrict themselves to only the low level xlib and the x athena widget set (libx11.a, libxaw.a, libxmu.a and libxt.a). x don't use m*tif, xv*ew, or openl*ok toolkits, since not everyone x has them. avoid depending on a particular window manager. not x everyone has x11r5, and some people are stuck back in x11r4 (or x earlier), so try to target x11r5 without requiring x11r5. better x yet, try to make your entry run on all version 11 x window systems. x x x client entries should not to depend on particular items on x .xdefaults. if you must do so, be sure to note the required lines x in the ---remark--- section. x x we like programs that: x x * are as concise and small as they need to be x * do something at least quasi-interesting x * pass lint without complaint (not a requirement, but it is nice) x * are portable x * are unique or novel in their obfuscation style x * make use of a number of different types of obfuscation x * make us laugh and/or throw up :-) x x some types of programs can't excel in some areas. of course, your x program doesn't have to excel in all areas, but doing well in several x areas really does help. x x we freely admit that interesting, creative or humorous comments in x the ---remark--- section helps your chance of winning. if you had to x read of many twisted entries, you too would enjoy a good laugh or two. x we think the readers of the contest winners do as well. x x be creative! x x xentry format: x x in order to help us process the many entries, we must request your x assistance by formatting your entries in a certain way. this format, x in addition, allows us to quickly separate information about the x author from the program itself. (see judging process) x x we have provided the program, mkentry, as an example of how to x format entries. you should be aware of the following warning that x is found in mkentry.c: x x this program attempts to implement the ioccc rules. every x attempt has been made to make sure that this program produces x an entry that conforms to the contest rules. in all cases, x where this program differs from the contest rules, the x contest rules will be used. be sure to check with the x contest rules before submitting an entry. x x you are not required to use mkentry. it is convenient, however, x as it attempts to uuencode the needed files, and attempt to check x the entry against the size rules. x x if you have any suggestions, comments, fixes or complaints about x the mkentry.c program, please send email to the judges.

(for the curious, x we do indicate the volume of paper consumed when presenting the ioccc x winners at talks) x x after the usenix announcement, we attempt to send email to the x authors of the winning entries. one reason we do this is to give x the authors a chance to comment on the way we have presented their x entry. they are given the chance to correct mistakes, typos. we x often accept their suggestions/comments about our remarks as well. x this is done prior to posting the winners to the wide world. x x judging consists of a number of elimination rounds. during a round, x the collection of entries are divided into two roughly equal piles; x the pile that advances on to the next round, and the pile that does x not. we also re-examine the entries that were eliminated in the x previous round. thus, an entry gets at least two readings. x x a reading consists of a number of actions: x x * reading the ---entry--- section x * reading the uudecoded ---build--- section x * reading the uudecoded ---program--- section x * reading the uudecoded ---info--- section(s), if any x * passing the source thru the c pre-processor x shipping over any #include files x * performing a number of c beautify/cleanup edits on the source x * passing the beautified source thru the c pre-processor x shipping over any #include files x x in later rounds, other actions are performed: x x * linting the source x * compiling/building the source x * running the program x * performing misc tests on the source and binary x x until we reduce the stack of entries down to about 25 entries, entries x are judged on an individual basis. an entry is set aside because it x does not, in our opinion, meet the standard established by the round. x when the number of entries thins to about 25 entries, we begin to form x award categories. entries begin to compete with each other for awards. x an entry often will compete in several categories. x x the actual award category list will vary depending on the types of entries x we receive. a typical category list might be: x x * best small one line program x * best small program x * strangest/most creative source layout x * most useful obfuscated program x * best game that is obfuscated x * most creatively obfuscated program x * most deceptive c code x * best x client (see our likes and dislikes) x * best abuse of ansi c x * worst abuse of the rules x * <anything else so strange that it deserves an award> x x we do not limit ourselves to this list. for example, a few entries are so x good/bad that they are declared winners at the start of the final round. x we will invent awards categories for them, if necessary. x x in the final round process, we perform the difficult tasks of x reducing the remaining entries (typically about 25) down to 8 or 10 x winners. often we are confident that the entries that make it into x the final round are definitely better than the ones that do not x make it. the selection of the winners out of the final round, is x less clear cut. x x sometimes a final round entry good enough to win, but is beat out x by a similar, but slightly better entry. for this reason, it is x sometimes worthwhile to re-enter an improved version of an entry x that failed to win in a previous year. this assumes, of course, x that the entry is worth improving in the first place! x x more often that not, we select a small entry (usually one line), a x strange/creative layout entry, and an entry that abuses the contest x rules in some way. x x in the end, we traditionally pick one entry as 'best'. sometimes such x an entry simply far exceeds any of the other entry. more often, the x 'best' is picked because it does well in a number of categories. x x xannouncement of winners: x x the first announcement, occurs at a summer usenix conference. by tradition, x this is done during the latter part of the uunet/ioccc bof, just prior to x the berkeley bsd, and bsdi bof. x x winning entries will be posted in late june to the following groups: x x comp.lang.c comp.unix.wizards alt.sources x x in addition, pointers to these postings are posted to the following x x comp.sources.d alt.sources.d misc.misc x comp.sources.misc comp.windows.x x x winning entries will be deposited into the uunet archives. see x below for details. x x often, winning entries are published in selected magazines. winners x have appeared in books (\"the new hackers dictionary\") and on t-shirts. x x last, but not least, winners receive international fame and flames!

            "why do spacecraft have to be shut off after funding cuts. for example, why couldn't magellan just be told to go into a \"safe\" mode and stay bobbing about venus in a low-power-use mode and if maybe in a few years if funding gets restored after the economy gets better (hopefully), it could be turned on again. for that matter, why exactly were the apollo lunar experiments \"turned off\" rather than just \"safed\". was it political (i.e. as along as they could be used, someone would keep bugging congress for funds)? turning them off keeps them pesky scientists out of the bureaucrat's hair.... i've heard the argument that an active but \"uncontrolled\" spacecraft causes \"radio noise.\" i find that hard to believe that this could be a problem in a properly designed \"safe\" mode. this safe mode could be a program routine which causes the spacecraft to go to least fuel using orientation, and once a (week, month, year, whatever) attempts a signal lock on earth. at that time, if funding has been restored, the mission can continue. if no signal is recieved, the spacecraft goes back to the safe mode for another time period. as we would know when the spacecraft is going to try to contact earth, we could be prepared if necessary. as another a spacecraft could do at the attempted contact is beam stored data towards earth. if someone can receive it, great, if not, so it's lost and no big deal. by making the time and signal location generally known, perhaps someone in the world might be able and willing to intercept the data even if they're not willing to contact the spacecraft. i see this as being particularly useful for spacecraft which could have an otherwise long life and are in or are going to places which are otherwise unaccessible (jupiter/saturn orbit, exiting the solar system, etc). perhaps those designing future spacecraft (cassini, pluto flyby, etc) should consider designing in a \"pause\" mode in case their spacecraft gets the ax sometime in the future after completion of the primary mission. perhaps mars observer and galilleo could have some kind of routine written in for the post mission \"drift\" phase. so any holes in all this?",

            "may 13, 1993 _five russian soldiers sentenced to death in azerbaijan_ moscow (upi) -- five soldiers who served in russia's 7th army stationed in armenia were sentenced to death in the azerbaijani capital baku thursday for allegedly \"carrying out diversions and killing 30 azeri soldiers.\" a statement released by the news service of azeri president abulfaz elchibey said \"the sentence was final and was not subject to protest or appeal,\" the russian state news agency itar-tass reported. but the russian foreign ministry issued an appeal for the men to be handed over to the authorities in moscow for punishment. \"this would accord with modern standards of humanity towards those who have committed crimes,\" the statement reads. the five men, together with another soldier who received a 15-year prison sentence, were captured in september 1992 by azeri police in the kelbadzhar district of azerbaijan, between nagorno-karabakh and armenia. the supreme court in baku said the men had gone through special training in a company of the russian 7th army in the armenian capital yerevan, after which they were sent across the armenian-azeri border into nagorno-karabakh to carry out diversions against azeri troops. however, the russian foreign ministry statement claimed they had deserted the russian army and were fighting as mercenaries with armenian armed forces in the battle zone round karabakh. nagorno-karabakh is an armenian-populated enclave within azerbaijan which for five years has been fighting for independence from baku in a war that has left many thousands dead and uprooted hundreds of thousands from their homes. both yerevan and baku have always claimed that russian servicemen stationed in these caucasian republics, who were left behind after the break-up of the soviet union, are fighting as mercenaries in the karabakh war. the statement from moscow said the russian side repeatedly appealed to the azerbaijani government to show humanity and leniency in their treatment of the six men, and to hand them over to the russian authorities. it said that president boris yeltsin himself sent a letter with this request to his azeri counterpart elchibey. itar-tass said that the soldiers' defense attorneys had lodged an appeal for clemency.",

            "hmm, followup on my own posting... well, who cares. first let me try to work out the facts that we get to know about the clipper-chip, from what hellman and denning were able to tell us: the chip itself is not confined to (digital) telephony, but performs general encryption in a symmetric manner. the chip supports cfb ofb ecb (and whatever the fourth mode of operation for des is), the algorithm consists of 32 rounds of *whatever*, and takes 80-bit keys. input data seems to be 64 bit? yes. so if two people want secure communication (whatever that means when clipper is involved) they have first to agree on one secret key. (or is it one key per direction ?) they can exchange this key via dh-schemes or however. somehow the two feed their so won secret key into the clipper-chip which is now ready to work. the clipper chip carries an unique serial-number (30 bit's), and 160 key-bits. these 160 key-bits seem to have been gained by encrypting the serial-number with 160 seed-bits. (the seed-bits seem not to be stored in the chip) at beginning of communication (and perhaps at certain invtervals whithin??) before sending the fist real 64-bit output of the first encryption the clipper chip put's out packets (i guess 3) which represent the serial number, and the session key. this might look like x{ e[k; chipkeyk1+k2], serial number} where x is a transformation of these 3? packets involving a family-key. this family(sp?)-key is equal for all chips. (x might be a simple xor ???) after that, the (digital?) phone-call can be done as usual, every packet being encrypted and decrypted by clipper. denning describes how k1 and k2 shall be generated, using a seed of 160 bit's. now, leaving alone politics, which does not concern me as much as you, not being an american citicien(tm) [ :-) ] , there are some weak points in this scheme, which might be exploited by several parties. as far as i know about the generation of k1,k2 ; s1 and s2 look like the obvious backdoor. they could be used to generate the chip-keys by knowing the serial-number (and also the family-key) of the chip. i really can't imagine why these seeds would be needed otherwise, as true random-sources for the generation of the k1,k2 can be bought for not to much money. then, the escrows. each of them will get 80 bit of a 160-bit key. security could (as little as existant) be maximized by giving them 160-bits each, which have to be xored together to give the k1,k2. now let's simply assume the escrows are trustworthy, and can't be fooled by criminals or law enforchemnt agencies. (and there will be no quarrel between escrows and l.e.a which would hinder the l.e.a in doing their duties, and so on and so on) once the keys are surrendered, the corresponding chip is compromised forever. not very clever, imho [ :-)) ]. how about sending in the encrypted session-keys for each phone-call that the police (or whoever) want's to listen to? escrows could then simply decode this session-key and send it back to police. (and would naturally not do this after the warrant has expired...) this would be a better technical solution, but i guess politics will not work that way. apparently (as miss dennings stated) the only one performing actually decodes of intercepted messages shall be the fbi. great. so local guys can not inter- cept (understand) your traffic anymore. does this mean that the fbi monopolizes the right to do legal wiretaps ? (how is law over there, i have no idea who is allowed to tap, and who not) this certainly means that watched communi- cations will be routed automatically from the service-providing company to the fbi, if the communicaiton is a watched one. and this means as far as i understand it that the family-key has to be known by each switching- company, and those providing cellular-phone servies etcetc. so the family-key will not be very secret, and thus serial-numbers of calls will be readable by anybody who cares. i _like_ traffic-analysis! what do you guess, what happens, if you use the chip in ecb mode, and the first few packets of the chip are somehow lost or garbled? so the session key would not be actually broadcasted over the line? hmmm. shouldn't be so difficult to do *that* :^) and now a last point, for the other side. after all i have read and heard about clipper (not the programming language for dbase, is it ?

            "the following is based on copies i was given of some articles published in hearing instruments. i would appreciate any comments about this and other 'new' technology for hearing aids. the resound system was developed on the basis of some research at at&t and appears to take a different approach from other aids. it appears to me that a new 'programmable' aid like the widex just uses a more flexible (and programmable) version of the classical approach of amplifying some parts of the spectrum more than others and adding some compression to try and help out in 'noisy' situations. the major difference in the resound approach is that it divides the spectrum into low and high frequencies (splitting point is programmable), apparently based on the fact that lots of vowel information can be found in the low frequencies, while the important consonant information (unfortunately for me) is in the high frequencies. the two bands then are treated with different compression schemes which are programable. they have also developed a new fitting algorythm that builds on what they call 'abnormal growth of loudness'. this latter is interesting and fits my own personal experience, though i think the phrase is missleading. what appears to be the case is that as you exceed the minimum threshold for a person with hearing loss, the deficit becomes progresslively less compared to normals and by the time you reach the 'too loud' point the sensitivity curves appear to converge. this means that if you just boost all sound levels, you are overloading at the high end for people with hearing losses. hence what you want is progressively less amplification as the signal get closer to the maximum tolerable point. you want to boost low volume sounds more than high and do so potentially differently for the low and high frequency parts of the spectrum (specially for someone like me who is relatively normal up to 1000 cps and then falls off a cliff). aids with simple compressors don't descriminate between energy in the low and high frequencies and can therefor 'compress' useful high frequency information because of high volume of low frequency components. particularly impressive was the resound performance with whispered speech and in simulated restaurant noise situations.",

(exactly if you use newcomb's numbers rather than leverrier's.) of course not everybody believes einstein, and that's fine. but subsequent efforts to find any planets closer to the sun than mercury using radar have been fruitless. -bill gawne \"forgive him, he is a barbarian, who thinks the customs of his tribe are the laws of the universe.\" - g. j. caesar",

            "some people working a few cubes over have come up with this need, and it seems that someone out there just might have done it already, and can point me to some tools that would help. what they'd like to do is: given a window that is taking a long time to draw (because either the data is arriving over a slow link, or the $display is across a slow link), they would like to first paint a low-resolution version of the picture, and then repaint it in higher resolution. thus, the picture might first be generated in 1/4 resolution, with each 4x4 square of pixels being filled in with a single color. next, each 4x4 square would be replaced by 4 2x2 squares; finally the 1x1 version would be painted. since one of the scenarios is with the window being on the other side of a slow link, the low-res version obviously wouldn't be transmitted as a bitmap; that wouldn't help at all. instead, there would have to be a process on the far end that receives the low-res picture as a small bitmap, and blows up each pixel into a square (sorta like the magnifier programs do). this brings up the question of whether the x server can help. that is, when a window is opened, is there a way to ask that a \"filter\" program be run to process the pixels? or is the only way to use something like rsh to start up a remote process (\"permission denied\" ;-), and have it open a local window? it seems the most likely scenario is a library routine that starts up such a program remotely, and then accepts bitmaps, compressing each one by some amount, and sending them to the remote program to expand. but if there is something that x itself can do to help, it's be nice to hear about it. (i looked in several fms, but if it's there, i obviously don't know the keywords ;-). if someone has a nifty tool available that packages it all, we might want to get a copy. oh, yes; this is to run on some suns. part of the idea is to build demos that can show such things as \"if this were run across, say, a 4800-bps link, this is how fast the pictures would appear.\" then the customer would get a feel for the speed that they need to pay for.",

            "there is an interesting opinion piece in the business section of today's la times (thursday april 15, 1993, p. d1). i thought i'd post it to stir up some flame wars - i mean reasoned debate. let me preface it by saying that i largely agree that the \"space age\" in the romantic sense of several decades ago is over, and that projects like the space station miss the point at this time. reading, for example, \"what's new\" - the weekly physics update we get here on the net - it's clear that the romance of the day lies in the ever more fine-grained manipulation of matter: by which i include biotechnology, condensed matter physics (with its spinoffs in computer hardware and elsewhere), and the amazing things people are doing with individual atoms these days. to a large extent, i think, the romance some people still have with space is a matter of nostalgia. i feel sure that someday we - or more precisely, our \"mind children\" - will spread across space (unless we wipe ourselves out); but i think that *manned* space exploration is not what is exciting about what we can do *now*. anyway, let me quote some of this article, but not all... space age glory fades from view micheal schrage (writer, consultant, and research associate at mit) at 35, america's space age won't have to suffer through the angst of a midlife crisis. the reason is that the space age is already dead. the technologies no longer define our times, and the public has grown weary of the multibillion -dollar celestial investments that yield minimal psychic or economic rewards. space exploration has mutated from a central focuse of america's science and technology debate into a peripheral issue. speace is not a meaningful part of the ongoing industrial competitiveness debate, our technology infrastructure discussions or even our defense conversion policy. to be sure, america should continue to invest in satellite technologies for telecommunications and remote sensing - cheap deep-space probes would be nice too - but the ideal of space as a meaningful driver of scientific and industrial innovation is now dead. ..... before the change in administrations, it would have been foolish to write an obituary for the space age. the bush white house aggressively supported the space program and proposed spending well over $30 billion to build space station freedom alone. even as he proposed budget cuts in other science and technology domains, office of management and budget director richard darman was an outspoken public champion of big-ticket space expenditures. the reality that much of the civilian space program - from the shuttle to the hubble telescope to the space station - was poorly conceived and unimpressively implemented did not seem to matter much. political inertia and a nostalgic sense of futurism - not a coherent vision or cost-effective sensibilities - determined multibillion-dollar space budgets. indeed, with few notable exceptions, such as voyager, the post-apollo era is the story of the gold-plated porkification of space exploration with programs and promises that delivered less for more and more. ...... while the clinton administration has kept on the highly regarded daniel goldin as administrator of the national aeronautics and space administration, it seems clear that space exploration is not being positioned as either a symbolic or substantive centerpiece of america's technological prowess. the space station budget has - rightly - been slashed. space is virtually ignored when the administration champions its competitiveness agenda. ......",

            "for src in most languages, the feast of the resurrection of our lord is known as the pasch, or pasque, or some variation thereof, a word which comes from the hebrew pesach, meaning \"passover.\" in english, german, and a few related languages, however, it is known as easter, or some variation thereof, and questions have been asked about the origin of this term. one explanation is that given by the venerable bede in his de ratione temporum 1:5, where he derives the word from the name of an anglo-saxon goddess of spring called eastre. bede is a great scholar, and it is natural to take his word for it. but he lived 673-735, and augustine began preaching in kent in 597. the use of the word easter to describe the feast would have been well established before the birth of bede and probably before the birth of anyone he might have discussed the subject with. it seems likely that his derivation is just a guess, based on his awareness that there had been an anglo-saxon goddess of spring bearing that name, and the resemblance of the words. thus, if the said resemblance (surely it is not surprising that a personification of spring should have a name similar to the word for dawn) is not in istelf convincing, the testimony (or rather the conjecture) by bede does not make it more so. assuming that bede was right, that would not justify saying that the christian celebration (which, after all, had been going on for some centuries before the name easter was applied to it) has pagan roots. it would simply mean that the anglo-saxons, upon becoming christians and beginning to celebrate the resurrection by a festival every spring, called it by the name that to them meant simply \"spring festival.\" however, bede's is not the only theory that has been proposed. j knoblech, in \"die sprach,\" zeitschrift fuer sprachwissenschaft 5 (vienna, 1959) 27-45, offers the following derivation: among latin-speaking christians, the week beginning with the feast of the resurrection was known as \"hebdomada alba\" (white week), since the newly-baptized christians were accustomed to wear their white baptismal robes throughout that week. sometimes the week was referred to simply as \"albae.\" translaters rendering this into german mistook it for the plural of \"alba,\" meaning \"dawn.\" they accordingly rendered it as eostarum, which is old high german for \"dawn.\" this gave rise to the form easter in english. yours, james kiefer",

            "i can think of a couple of ways of guaranteeing authenticity in a one-time pad encrytped scheme, though i'm not sure how to prove that what kind of authenicity they provide. an obvious first-attempt might be to prepend a truly random (unpredictable for eve) block to the message, and then calculate a crc which included the random starting block and all of the message. this could be encrypted after the message. the problem is, i'm not sure it's impossible to come up with a message that will hash to the same crc regardless of the random starting block. (it intuitively seems like it ought to be hard, but i'm not *that* sure....) clearly, a crypto-strength hash like md5 or the sha would be stronger, but again, i'm not sure i'm comfortable claiming that it's unbreakable. a scheme to use up some of the pad bits to decide how many bits of 0's to include in the plaintext stream before going on wouldn't be too bad, either. at the cost of increasing the speed with which you use up your pad, this could be used to give you arbitrarily low probability that your opponent could spoof a valid-looking message, since any deciphered plaintext in a spot that should be carrying 0's will show that something funny's going on. if, for each message bit m_i, we used up one random bit, r_i, to decide whether to insert a 0 into the plaintext stream, we'd get a total pad use of 2.5 times the message length. (we'd expand the message size by about half.) each 0 that should appear in the plaintext stream that doesn't is a guess for our would-be spoofer. at each bit, she has to guess. i'm trying to see how to quantify her chances of making it all the way through the spoofed message, but it gets a little complicated, because she can get un- synched, and still happen to have a 0 in that place in the spoofed message. now, i can see a simple way of doing this that's got to be as secure as a one-time pad, at a cost of using 4 times the message length in pad bits. for each message bit, m_i, use one random bit, r_i, and xor them together to get x_i. now, encrypt the three bits with the one-time pad. the enemy has no way of guessing what r_i is, so he/she can't guess what x_i is, either. any change she makes in the ciphertext stream will have to involve a guess of what r_i was. is there any way to do this without using so many pad bits? spoofing the message is equivalent to correctly guessing as many random bits as there are bits in the message. clearly, this makes spoofing messages just as hard if you know the whole message text as if you know none of it. in fact, it looks to me like this makes it just as hard to generate a spoofed message with the ciphertext as without it, but i'm not entirely sure about that. is there an easier way of doing this that's provably as secure as the one-time pad?",

            "i don't know, but i'm as willing to speculate as anyone. several people have suggested that the chips use public-key cryptography. another possibility is to use diffie-hellman key exchange, or some other algorithm which has a similar effect. dh allows both ends to agree on a session key which they use with symmetric cryptography (something like des) for the encryption. how could the \"back door\" keys work in this system? i can see a few possibilities. one is that the dh-like algorithm has the property that the session key can be deduced by an eavesdropper who knows the back door keys for one (or possibly both) communicants. perhaps the random numbers used in the dh are seeded by the back door key, or some such. another possibility, as was suggested here earlier, is that the chips simply broadcast the session key, encrypted with the chip's own internal secret key. in this system the back door keys are secret keys usable for decrypting this session key broadcast. actually the chip's secret key doesn't need to be a public key in this usage, but can be identical to the secret back-door key. (this proposal seems most straightforward to me.) still another possibility is that the encryption algorithm used for the message itself has a \"dual key\" property, that possession of either of two keys can be used to decrypt it. one key would be the session key from the dh exchange, and the other would be the back door key for the chip. it's worth noting that one of the proposals dorothy denning raised during her amazingly prescient on-line discussion last november and december was a variation on diffie-hellman in which a third party would participate in deriving the session keys. this doesn't quite fit into what we know of how clipper works but it hints that those who had early knowledge of clipper (or whose thinking was somehow synchronized with clipper designers) may have had diffie-hellman on their minds.",

            "[stuff deleted] the last year before bryan murray took over, the wings did not make the playoffs. while they had been considered a possible contender when jacques demers first arrived, in his last two years they were, respectively, embarrassed in the first round by chicago, and then failed to make the playoffs (at a time, a might add, when there were only five teams in the norris). it's true that vancouver did not make the playoffs for many a year before quinn came, but in those years the smythe division was a lot--i mean *a lot*-- tougher division than the norris, also known as the \"snorris\", division. vancouver had to play edmonton and calgary, both very legitimate stanley cup contenders, eight times a year, while detroit got to play such powerhouses as toronto and minnesota. now, edmonton is hardly even a force in the league, and the smythe even has the mighty san jose sharks, while over this same period of time in which vancouver was improving, so was everybody in the norris (except st. louis). detroit had to improve just to keep up with the competition in their division. they had to improve *a lot* to get better than their competition in the norris. bryan murray inherited a team with very little talent. for really good players, they had yzerman, burr, and probert, and that was about it. (and no doubt some will dispute whether burr and probert were that good). the rest were either very green rookies or washed up veterans. the only reason they got as far as they did in the years before murray came was due to the coaching of demers, who, at least at first, got every last ounce of effort possible out of his team. then, even his coaching began to degrade. there are a number of reasons why detroit wasn't in as bad a shape standings wise when murray took over as vanc. was when quinn took over, some of which i outlined above, but murray did not have any better personnel to work with at the outset than did quinn, with the exception of yzerman. and one player cannot alone make a team into a stanley cup contender, as i'm sure everyone reading this will agree. we'll be able to see better which team is really the most improved when they face each other in the conference final (assuming they don't get knocked out, like last year).",

            "intro to access.bus (re: the access.bus software creator's contest announcement) what is access.bus? access.bus is a new open industry standard for computer peripheral connectivity. access.bus is a serial protocol that uses simple, low-cost i2c technology to link multiple devices to a single pc port. peripheral devices such as keyboards or keypads, locators (mice, trackballs, joysticks), printers, vr gloves, digitizers, sensors, actuators or data transmitters and others can be easily daisy chained to the host pc. applications such as cad/cam, data acquisition, simulation, virtual reality, multiple-player/single pc games, education and many, many more can now take advantage of access.bus, the technology that puts plug and play on every pc. the access.bus offers advantages to end-users and developers of systems and peripherals. multiple devices connect to the host computer with only one port. common communication methods for a number of device types lead to simplified hardware and software development. as an open standard, access.bus enables cross- platform use of the same device. access.bus technological description: ===================================== access.bus technology is an open specification, enabling anyone to implement it on host systems or in peripheral devices without fee or royalty. access.bus has a bus topology architecture. that is, a single host can accommodate up to 125 peripheral devices. access.bus data rate is 100 kbits/sec. access.bus physical layer ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ access.bus is a serial bus architecture, based on i2c hardware protocol, with one data line and one clock line. standard low-cost i2c microcontrollers handle bit-level handshaking, including automatic arbitration and clock synchronization. access.bus software protocols ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ the access.bus communication protocol is composed of three levels: i2c protocol, base protocol, and application protocol. i2c protocol: this simple and efficient protocol defines arbitration among contending masters without losing data. i2c provides for cooperative synchronization of bus partners with different clock rates. bus transactions include addressing, framing of bits into bytes, and byte acknowledgment by the receiver. base protocol: establishes the asymmetrical interconnect between a host computer and multiple peripherals. the host becomes the access.bus manager. the base protocol defines the format of an access.bus message envelope, which is an i2c bus transaction with additional semantics, including checksum. unique features of the base protocol are auto-addressing and hot plugging. auto-addressing assigns devices with unique bus addresses, without the need for setting jumpers or switches. hot plugging is the ability to attach and detach devices while the system is running, without rebooting. application protocol: this is the highest level of the access.bus protocol which defines message semantics specific to particular types of devices. each type requires a different application protocol. three broad device types have been identified: keyboards, locators, and text devices. access.bus support on the pc ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ all three levels of the access.bus protocol are supported on the pc. an add-on card implements the physical layer and uses the base protocol to communicate with physical access.bus devices. an access.bus manager - tsr under dos and a dll under windows 3.1 - controls the operation of the physical layer and interacts with the access.bus device drivers. drivers are available for multiple access.bus keyboards, locators and printers for dos and windows 3.1. also available are c language source code examples of the interface from applications to the device drivers. to contact abig (the access.bus industry group):",

            "there is no easy answer to this question: it depends on whether the display device can hold pixmaps in off-screen memory, and if so, how efficiently the server manages these resources (having to deal with limited off-screen memory is the bane of the server implementor's existence!). i have worked with graphics devices where the off-screen memory to main display copy rate eclipses that of the main memory to display copy rate, and with those where the main memory to display is *faster* than off-screen to display (requires only a write to the framebuffer rather than a read of the f.b. followed by a write) if your server uses the cfb code or something like it to render into pixmaps in cpu main memory, the rates you can get through mit-shm are likely to be equal (maybe a tad slower, depending on your os's implementation of shared memory) to copyarea from pixmap to window, which is also then just a copy from cpu main memory to graphics device. one advanage of mit-shm is that if your images are large, you don't end up growing the size of the server process to hold them. one disadvantage of the mit-shm is that, in its sample implementation, there is no provision for elegantly cleaning up the shared memory segments if the client dies a sudden, violent death (e.g., \"kill\"). you have to be mindful of cluttering up the system with zombie shared memory segments. ken",
            "the moderator of the general assembly, the rev. john fife, visited our church about a week ago (just 4 days after rev. spahr--it's been a busy week for our small church!!). he was asked specifically about the issue of homosexuality and what he thinks will happen at the ga meeting next month. evidently, there are 15-20 known resolutions pending that range the gamut from \"outlawing\" homosexuality altogether to \"legalizing\" it completely. he will readily admit that this is probabaly the most difficult issue that the church has had to deal with since the presbyterian church split in two over the issue of slavery more than 100 years ago. without question, the issue may split the church again after we've been reunited for all of a dozen years or so. he is hopeful that it will not and is pushing the same attitude that helped the church deal with the abortion issue last year as a solution. he is hoping to pass a resolution that more or less states that we, the members of the church \"agree to disagree\" on the issue, admitting that both sides have honestly studied the scriptures and had the spirit lead them to different conclusions. it worked last year when the abortion issue threatened to do more or less the same thing, and he is hopeful that the ga can foster a loving and caring attitude about people who disagree with their own view. -- cliff slaughterbeck | dept. of physics, fm-15 | it's time for the sermon on the university of washington | grand torino! seattle, wa 98195 |",

            "the following is from a critique of a \"60 minutes\" presentation on msg which was aired on november 3rd, 1991. the critique comes from the tufts diet and nutrition letter, february 1992. [...edited for brevity...] \"chances are good that if you watched '60 minutes' last november 3rd [1991], you came away feeling msg is bad for you. [...] in the segment entitled 'no msg,' for instance, show host ed bradley makes alarming statements without adequately substantiating them ('millions are suffering a host of symptoms, and some get violently sick'); peppers his report with sensational but clinically unproven personal testimony...; and speaks of studies on msg that make the substance seem harmful without explaining just how inconclusive those studies are. consider his making reference at the beginning of the program to a study conducted at the eastern virginia medical school in order to back up his comment that there is 'a lot of evidence' that msg, a flavor enhancer in chinese and other asian cuisines as well as in many supermarket items, causes headaches. what he does not make reference to is the fact that the study was performed not on humans but on rabbits. one of the researchers who conducted the study, pharmacologist patricia williams, ph.d., says it certainly is conceivable that a small minority of people are sensitive enough to msg to get headaches from it. 'but,' she explains, 'the show probably overemphasized the extent of the problem.' a second lapse comes with mention of dr. john olney, a professor at the washington university school of medicine who, mr. bradley remarks, 'says that his 20 years of research with laboratory animals shows msg is a hazard for developing youngsters' because it poses a threat of irreversible brain damage. dr. olney's research with lab animals does not 'show' anything about human youngsters. in fact, only under extreme circumsrtances did dr. olney's experiments ever bring about any brain damage: when he injected extremely high doses of msg into rodents, completely bypassing their digestive tracts and entering their bloodstreams more directly, and when he used tubes to force-feed huge amounts of the substance to very young animals on an empty stomach. of course, neither of those procedures occurs with humans; they simply take in msg with food. and most of what they take in is broken down by enzymes in the wall of the small intestine, so that very little reaches the bloodstream -- much to little, in fact, for human blood levels of msg to come anywhere near the high concentrations found in dr. olney's lab animals..... the world health organization appears to be very much aware of that fact. and so does the european communities' scientific committee for food....both, after examining numerous studies, have concluded that msg is safe. their determination makes sense, considering that msg has never been proven to cause all the symptoms that have been attributed to it -- headaches, swelling, a tightness in the chest, and a burning sensation, among others. in fact, the most fail-safe of clinical studies, the double-blind study..., has consistently exonerated the much-maligned substance. that's quite fortunate since the alleged hazardous component of monosodium glutamate, glutamate, enters our systems whenever we eat any food that contains protein. the reason is that one of the amino acids that make up protein, glutamic acid, is broken down into glutamate during digestion. it's a breakdown that occurs frequently. glutamic acid is the most abundant of the 20 or so amino acids in the diet. it makes up about 15 percent of the protein in flesh foods, 20 percent in milk, 25 percent in corn, and 29 percent in whole wheat. that doesn't mean it's entirely unimaginable that a small number of people have trouble metabolizing msg properly and are therefore sensitive to it...the consensus reached by large, international professional organizations [is that msg is safe], the same consensus reached by the fda and the biomedical community at large.\"",

            "speaking of siggraph, i just went through the ordeal of my annual registration for siggraph and re-upping of membership in the acm last night, and was i ever grossed out! the new prices for membership are almost highway robbery! for example: siggraph basic fee went from $26 last year to $59 this year for the same thing, a 127% increase. those facile enough to arrange a trip to the annual conference could reduce this to $27 by selecting siggraph lite, which means siggraph is charging an additional $32 (or so) for the proceedings and the art show catalog, essentially. toplas went up 40% in cost, way outstripping the current inflation rate. basic sigchi fees remainded the same, but whereas before sigchi membership included uist and human factors conferences proceedings, these are now an extra cost option. bundling that back into the basic rate, equivalent services have gone up 100% in cost. sigois membership cost has up 33%, but they've also split out the computer supported cooperative work conference proceedings that used to be included with membership. adding that cost back in means this sig also has doubled its membership fee. what really galls me is that the acm sent out brochures a couple months ago touting their new approach to providing member services, and tried to make it sound like they were offering new services. but with the exception of a couple, like siggraph, all the \"plus\" services appear to be just splitting the costs into smaller piles so that they don't look so big. but their recommended changes to my membership would have me paying 90% more than last year for a 31% increase in services (measured by cost, not by value), and, curiously, a 31% inflation rate on the publications i got last year. is anyone out there as galled by this extortion as i am? ________________________________________________________________________________ robert reed home animation ltd. 503-656-8414 robert@slipknot.rain.com 5686 first court, west linn, or 97068 shooting yourself in the foot in various languages and systems",

(i am thinking of the ontological argument, the cosmological argument and the teleological argument. those are the ones traditional enough to have funny names, anyway.) this is the real question. so to discuss it, i'll assume god exists. otherwise, there is no heavenly authority to babble about. please show this is the case. i am familiar with the first cause argument, and i'll accept (for the sake of argument) that there is a first cause, even though i find some of its premices questionable. the rest you'll have to show. this includes that the first cause is god. got it. i deny that god is all good. so there. this isn't self-consistent: if humans must renew the relationship, then god (incarnate or not) can't do it. well, unless you think god is human. granted, god made himself 'human', but this is nonetheless cheating: the intent of the statement is clearly that man has to fix the problem he caused. god fixing it- even by indirect means- contradicts this. why? also, why assume said claim is true anyway? if *i* claim to be truth, are you bound by reason to follow me? :) undoubtably. do you mean to imply we should all obey the commands of the marines without question? you seem to imply this about god, and that the marines are similar in this respect.. if this is not what you are trying to say, they please explain what it is you are saying, as i have missed it. why? why not question it? even if it *is* truth, we cannot know this certainly, so why is it so irrational to question? perhaps we will thus discover that we were wrong. you assert that god is truth and we can't question truth. but i assert that god is not truth and anyway we can question truth. how is it my assertion is less good than yours? oh? i hereby deny 1+1=2. i hope you'll agree 1+1=2 is the truth. granted, i look pretty damn silly saying something like that, but i needed something we'd both agree was clearly true. now, you'll notice no stormtroopers have marched in to drag me off to the gulag. no heaven lighting bolts either. no mysterious net outages. i seem to be permited to say such things, absurd or not. they are certainly not true. at least, the ones newton derived are not true, and are indeed wildly inaccurate at high speeds or small distances. we do not have a set of laws of physics that always works in all cases. if we did, physics would be over already. science is all about questioning this sort of truth. if we didn't, we'd still follow aristotle. i'd generalize this a little more: if you want to learn anything new, you must question the things you know (tm). because you can always be wrong. even presupposing that truth may not be denied, and may not be questioned, and that god is truth, it only follows that god may not be denied or questioned. not that he must be obeyed! we could unquestioningly disobey him. how annoying of us. but you have not connected denial with disobedience. --- - dan \"no nickname\" johnson and god said \"jeeze, this is dull\"... and it *was* dull. genesis 0:0",
            "though this will be addressed in the series of articles i'm posting now under \"aresnokoitia\", i can't wait. this just really blew my socks off. read i tim 1: 3-11. verses 3-8 speaks against those who have perverted the teachings of the mosaic law. in vv.9-10, we have, *in order*, the 5th thru the 9th commandments and in the midst of this listing is \"homosexuals.\" the decalogue, above everything else, is seen as god's absolute. if you don't believe in absolutes, then you have nothing do do with jehovah of the ot, which paul reveals to be the messiah of the nt. \"lord christ jesus\" transliterates to read \"jehovah's anointed savior.\" in i cor5, we see the same emphasis of moral separation from the pagan gentiles as we do in lev 18-20. in i cor 6:9-10, only one notation (drunkards) is not found in lev 18-20. paul was not naive in his use of the lxx. he knew full well how he was using the law of god that was given in the ot, for application in the nt. as i've said, the law was fulfilled, not done away with. this understanding is thoroughly rebutted in deyoungs article that is being posted. please refer to it. we can do better than \"probably\" which is not an adequate defense against the statement that paul's culture didn't have the same understanding of homosexuality as ours. again read the article because it uses facts. i think i do, because i have worked in the homosexual community by means of working with aids patients. the pastoral is merely the practical application of the theological truth however. those who are working thru the issue of homosexuality need to have our love and understanding just as with a friend who is contiplating cheating on his wife or a friend who lives with his girlfriend, yet you continue to witness to him. but, once the choice is made, and there is no remorse, then i feel that paul's \"pastoral\" care, as presented in the corinthian church, come to bear significance. the one in active rebellion should be placed outside of the church if a believer, and if a non-believer, then one wipes his sandels and leaves it in gods hand. if there was a member in your youth group who was constantly pawing at the little girls, you wouldn't hesitate to deal with the matter quickly and decisivly. that, in part, betrays the present \"political correctness\" of the issue. pederasty is not accepted at the present, but some how we are to accept homosexuality because the latter is politically correct, while the former is not -at least not yet. this is how the morals decay. i guess this would follow the liberal application in the political realm of economics. the liberals want to tax the rich in the federal, yet in their own states, when they try to get businesses to settle there, they give tax incentives to these same richies. it comes down to a moral code of relativeness, or to use the cultural thing, politically correct -at the moment. --rex",

            "yesterday, i went to the boeing shareholders meeting. it was a bit shorter than i expected. last year (when the stock was first down), they made a big presentation on the 777, and other programs. this year, it was much more bare-bones. in any case, i wanted to ask a question that the board of directors would hear, and so i got there early, and figured that if i didn't get to the mike, maybe they would read mine off of a card, and so i wrote it down, and handed it in. after the meeting started, mr. shrontz said that he would only answer written questions, in order to be fair to the people in the overflow room that only had monitors downstairs. naturally, i was crushed. so, when question and answer time came, i was suprised to find my question being read and answered. admittedly near the end of the ones that he took. presumably getting there early, and getting the question in early made all the difference. so, on to the substance. the question was is boeing looking at anything beyond the high speed civil transport, such as a commercial space launch system, and if not, how will boeing compete with the reusable single stage to orbit technology presently being developed by mcdonnell douglass? well, he read it without a hitch, and without editing, with impressed me, then he answered it very quickly treating it as a two part question, last part first. this is to the best of my recollection what he said. as far as single stage to orbit technology, we think that we have a better answer in a two stage approach, and we are talking to some of our customers about that. as far as commercialization, that is a long ways off. the high speed civil transport is about as far out as our commercial planning goes at this point. so, this tells me that boeing still considers space to be a non-commercial arena, and for the most part this is true, however it also tells me that they consider there to be enough money in building space launchers for them to persue work on their own. now, i do have a friend on the spacelifter program at boeing. actually, this is a mis-nomer, as there is no spacelifter contract for the work that this guy is doing, however, he is doing work in preparation of a proposal for space lifter contracts. he won't tell me what he is doing, but maybe this is where the tsto action is taking place at boeing. at the very minimum, the chairman of the board of boeing said that they have an approach in mind, and they are trying to do something with it. anybody know anything further? is this really news? does this threaten further work on dc-? ?",

            "the white house office of the press secretary _____________________________________________________________________ for immediate release april 15, 1993 press briefing by dee dee myers the briefing room 9:45 a.m. edt q why was the 10:00 a.m. postponed? ms. myers: just due to scheduling conflicts. so as we put out, the president will meet with the leaders of the national police organizations at 2:00 p.m. in the rose garden, as opposed to 10:00 a.m. the only other things on his schedule today are: at 11:00 a.m. he'll meet with general vessey, who, as you know, is on his way to vietnam to continue working on the mia-pow issue. at 12:30 p.m. he'll have lunch with the vice president in the oval office. and at 2:00 p.m. he'll meet with the police organizations. then from 3:00 p.m. to 4:00 p.m. he'll do his weekly photos with the various groups. q a photo op with vessey? ms. myers: there's no coverage on the vessey meeting. q why? ms. myers: why? it's a closed meeting. q what about the lunch? ms. myers: the lunch? no, there's no coverage. q is he meeting with any congress people today? ms. myers: nothing scheduled. q there are no meetings -- ms. myers: there are no congressional meetings today, no. q has the president been given any information by the pentagon or reached any conclusion about the validity of this report from hanoi? any instructions to vessey on how to deal with the vietnamese on that subject? ms. myers: well, clearly, the report is the first order of business. it's high on the agenda on something that they'll discuss. i think the president and general vessey will discuss the parameters of his visit to vietnam today, but the president hasn't drawn any conclusions about the report yet. certainly, it's something that he wants general vessey to talk with the vietnamese about first. q did the president talk with any republican senators yesterday about the stimulus package? ms. myers: he spoke with senator dole. q how many times? ms. myers: i believe once during the day and once last night. q what was the outcome of that? ms. myers: they're continuing to work toward some kind of an agreement on a jobs package. q is it your impression that senator dole is in any way flexible on this? ms. myers: well, i think we're hopeful that we're going to get some kind of jobs package through the senate, and we'll continue to work with senator dole and others until we reach some kind of an agreement. q did they discuss the vat tax? ms. myers: i don't know if that came up. q can you check that? ms. myers: sure. q so what are they -- is the president offering to scale down his program -- is that what he's trying to do, buy it down to where dole will sign on? ms. myers: well, he's trying to protect as much of it as he can. but it's important to him to get some kind of a jobs package through the senate and through congress now. and as soon as we reach some conclusions on that, we'll let you know. but at the moment, he's continuing to consult with members of congress including, obviously, senator dole. q is he talking to anybody else? ms. myers: i don't believe he talked to any other republicans yesterday. q is he talking to anybody today? ms. myers: i don't think anything is scheduled, but i wouldn't rule it out. q we were led to believe that the president called mr. dole on the subject of russian aid and that bob dole brought the conversation around to stimulus package. is that correct? ms. myers: i think the president has contacted several people on russian aid. i think that it was always expected that the stimulus package or the jobs package will be part of any conversation he would have with senator dole. the primary objective of the conversation was russian aid. that was the first order of business, but it was both. q in the president's mind, are they linked politically in that if the republicans continue to reject the stimulus package, he thinks it will be harder to sell russian aid to the american people? has he made that argument? ms. myers: i can't talk about specifically what arguments he might have made. the president is obviously committed to both. he liked to see a jobs package to the american people first. but as you know, we outlined the details of additional russian aid last night in tokyo. q but does the president believe that the stimulus package will make it more difficult to persuade americans to vote for russian -- to accept a vote for russian aid? ms. myers: i think that the president is going to continue to work to pass the stimulus package, to pass a jobs package, and we're still hopeful that we'll get some kind of jobs package through the congress. q is it fair to say that the president is negotiating now with dole? ms. myers: he's discussing options with him. q on the stimulus, is it your understanding that over the break some democrats, themselves, have left the support that they had earlier for the package, the stimulus package? ms. myers: i think we still have wide support in the senate for the jobs package. q but specifically, that you've lost democrats other than shelby? ms. myers: i don't believe so. there hasn't been a vote. q what about kohl? q kohl and feingold? ms. myers: there hasn't been a vote yet. and we'll continue to work with senators to try to get a majority to try to bring the package to a vote, because we believe that a majority of the members of the united states senate support the package. q if you're weren't worried about kohl and feingold, why did george mention milwaukee projects the other day? ms. myers: i think george pointed out a number of projects in a number of states that stand to be funded, or to lose funding if this jobs package doesn't pass. q no democrats. (laughter.) ms. myers: i'll let you draw your own conclusions. q does he plan to talk to dole again today or any other republicans again today? ms. myers: there's nothing specifically scheduled, but again, i wouldn't rule it out. q does he plan to put out any more press releases to any other states today? ms. myers: what we've done is we're in the process of breaking down the benefits of the jobs package state by state. i think it's entirely feasible that as we sort of are able to sum those up, we'll send out press releases to the various states that suggest how their states would benefit from this package. q will you share those with us? ms. myers: sure. as we did yesterday. q do you have copies of the ones you sent -- ms. myers: yes, we made those available yesterday. and we certainly can continue to provide them today. q dee dee, since yesterday's questions and subsequent stories about the vat, what further consideration of this issue has been given? ms. myers: nothing's changed since yesterday. i think the president commented on it this morning to say only that it was something he knew was being considered by the task force and that he has not made a decision on, and i don't think we have anything to add to that. q but he also said that business and labor groups are telling him they support it. can you tell us -- ms. myers: i think that there has been -- i'm not going to speculate on who supports it. i think the president said that there has been some support among business and labor groups. i don't think he said he was directly contacted by them. q are we to take that to mean that the administration has sounded out business and labor groups on this -- ms. myers: i think there's been plenty of public discourse on this over the years and even recently, but i don't think i want to add to that. q in february, though, the president said that this was something to be considered 10 or 15 years down the road. what has happened between then and now to cause this administration to change its mind? ms. myers: i think as we said yesterday, it is something that the working groups are looking at. they're considering a wide variety of options on everything from funding to specific options that will be covered by the president's health care plan. the president has not taken it up yet, has not made a decision on it. and beyond that, i don't have anything to add. q you haven't answered the question. it wasn't being considered by anyone in the white house after the president's comments in february, and george reaffirmed that in a briefing. q and then suddenly -- q what happened? ms. myers: the working groups, as we have said throughout, we instructed to consider a wide variety of options across-the-board. and one of the things that has been talked about and that they are clearly considering is some kind of a value-added tax. q but the president himself took this off the table, dee dee, and suddenly it reappears. and this goes to the credibility of this administration in a way. what has happened in the meantime? ms. myers: the president has not looked at this, it hasn't been presented to him, again, yet. the working groups are looking at it, as they're looking at a wide variety of options, and no decisions have been made. q and it raises the question of how independently the task force is working. ms. myers: the task force was instructed to consider all options, and they've taken that mandate seriously and they're considering all options. q but that's not the impression that the president left in february. the impression he left was that this was something that was long-range, to be looked at 10, 15 years down the road. the clear implication of his remarks was that this was something that was not on the table, not an option. q \"if it changes i'll tell you.\" q bring him on. q and you repeatedly referred to the president's remarks, telling us that those were still in operation. ms. myers: it's changed, and we told you. (laughter.) q but that's what alice rivlin's comments and donna shalala comments were about. i mean, that seemed like an orchestrated effort because you have two independent cabinet officers -- ms. myers: i wouldn't -- no, alice rivlin's not a cabinet member, first of all. second of all, it was not orchestrated, but clearly, they both said yesterday and in the last couple of days that it's something that's being looked at. we confirmed that yesterday. and i don't have anything to add to that. q is it because he has very few options? q is this something that it will be incumbent upon the task force to convince the president about? in other words, has the president himself personally ruled it out and it's now up to the task force to convince him to put it back on the table? or is it, in fact, back on the table, having been placed there by discussions with the president? ms. myers: it is not the working group's mission at this point to convince the president of anything. it is their mission to put before him his options and to explain the benefits and the costs and the basic pros and cons of each of those options. i think that they will certainly present the vat to him in that context, and at this point he's not -- that presentation has not been made, but it's something that he will hear and he has not made a decision on. q they will present it to him as one of his options, though he specifically ruled it out? ms. myers: correct. q dee dee, is this more than a trial balloon? is this a serious consideration that the working groups are giving to this form of taxation? ms. myers: it's simply a statement of fact. the working groups are considering a wide variety of options on a number of issues relating to health care reform. one of the options that they're looking at is the vat. q dee dee, when the working groups were examining this possibility, was this on the table during the same time period that you were telling us that it was not? ms. myers: i don't know what the specific timing of their drafting of options is. i don't know. q who was telling you that it was not under consideration? ms. myers: i was referring back to the president's comments. q have they discovered that the sin taxes won't raise enough money to fund the core benefit package? ms. myers: no, there's no decisions that have been made on how to pay for the health care plan. q i'm asking whether the projections -- ms. myers: there's a number of options depending on how the plan is structured. you can't decide how much the plan is going to cost until you decide what the plan is going to look like. and so you can't discuss what financing options have been ruled in our out until you know. q dee dee, we've been told that they have a computer models on a number of possible packages. ms. myers: correct. q the question is whether they have now determined whether sin taxes would not produce enough money for even the barest minimum package. that is not a very difficult computation. ms. myers: it is a question that you know that we're not going to answer until -- there's a number of options being considered. it depends on how the package is structured. the exact details of the package and the financing mechanisms used to pay for them are all among the decisions that have yet to be made. q and when the president has been meeting with health care -- his health care advisors, which we are told he has been doing -- ms. myers: correct. q they have never once said to him, these are your funding options, including the vat? he has never heard the word vat in his -- ms. myers: i am not going to comment on the specific nature of the daily -- they're not daily, but the quasi-regular briefings. q well, you have. ms. myers: i have not, other than to say that he's not considered the vat. and i think that is a true statement. q no, but you said that it has not been presented to him as an option. ms. myers: correct. q that doesn't mean he hasn't heard about it. ms. myers: i'm not going to get into the details of what's discussed. i think that statement stands for itself. q specific, dee dee. when you say he hasn't looked at it, do you mean that he hasn't looked at it in terms of paying for medical coverage, or hasn't looked at it in general? because back in chilicothe he was very specific in defining how it works, what the advantages are, the whole thing. it sounds like -- ms. myers: but that was -- i think in chilicothe, if you go back to his remarks there, it was a broader philosophical discussion of the tax structure. and i think the comments were generally in reference to the overall economic plan. but clearly, it's something that he's thought about in the broad context. i mean, that was clear in chilicothe. what i'm saying is that in the process of the working groups it's something that he hasn't considered yet. it's something that the working groups will present to him among the number of options, and that no decisions have been made. and i'm not going to comment any further on the details of the meetings where health care issues are being discussed. q it's your statement from this podium that no discussion of this has taken place. you say that no option -- that the option has not been presented to him. ms. myers: that is correct. q do you stand by -- does the white house still stand by george's statement in march that this will not be in the proposal? ms. myers: no decisions have been made. we have nothing to add to what's already been said. q let me follow up here. do you stand by what rivlin said yesterday, that if any kind of vat were to be used or considered, that other changes to the tax code would have to be made so that it would be less regressive? ms. myers: i'm not going to comment any further on what might happen if. q but do you stand by the previous conversations in february that if there were to be a vat, i think the president said you'd exclude food and energy -- ms. myers: i'm not going to comment on the specific structure of a decision that hasn't been made. q was the president aware prior to donna shalala's comments yesterday that this was under consideration by the working groups? ms. myers: i don't know specifically what -- q could you check for us, because that's a real important credibility question? ms. myers: sure. q since the task force was brought together this issue has been discussed, at the beginning and throughout, as one fairly painless way to raise a lot of money. were you all kept in the dark? was the press office kept in the dark over the past month and a half when you've been denying that a vat tax would be considered that it was actually on the table over there as an option? ms. myers: i think we've said all that we have to say. it is something the working groups are looking at. the president has not made a decision about it yet. and beyond that, i have nothing to add. q well, sorry, dee dee, there are still a couple of questions that we are going to have to ask because we have a problem with credibility here -- yours primarily. what we're asking is, if you all were not told at all that this thing was being considered while you were coming out here and telling us that it was not, or if it's a case that you were coming out here and deliberately misleading us. ms. myers: i don't believe that anyone has ever come out here and deliberately misled you from this podium -- ever --ever. q has anyone tried to shade it a little bit to indicate something -- has anybody told anybody to come out -- ms. myers: we're not trying to shade answers or deliberately mislead anybody. i've said what i have to say about this issue. q all we were trying to find out -- ms. myers: i understand what you're trying to find out and i've given you the answers, helen. q we're trying to find out what changed -- what made it an option again. that's the -- ms. myers: the working groups were given a broad mandate to investigate all options, and they are doing that. q yes, but it wasn't an option before. how can you investigate it if the president has taken it off the table? ms. myers: it is something that they're obviously considering and the president has not made a decision on. q yes, but he took it off the table in february. ms. myers: working groups are considering it. they'll present it to the president at some point and he'll make a decision. q why would they consider it if he has taken it off the table? ms. myers: it's clearly on the table. q yes, but he took it off the table. did he change his mind? ms. myers: it's back on the table, bill. q did he change his mind? ms. myers: he said this morning that he hasn't made a decision about it. he obviously knows that it's on the table. it's something that he will look at at some and when we have a decision on this we'll let you know. q so he must have changed his mind, right? ms. myers: at some point it will be looked at. i mean, -- q dee dee, there's like two options -- either he changed his mind or the working groups think they're authority exceeds the president's. ms. myers: the working groups were given a broad mandate to look at all options; they've done that. q are you going to put out his income tax? ms. myers: yes, there will be something available on his income tax probably later this afternoon. his return will be available. q will there be any kind of briefing to go through it? ms. myers: no, nothing's planned. i think someone will be available, probably not in a briefing setting, but to walk you through the questions. q we're used to be walked line-by-line through the presidential tax forms. ms. myers: i've seen those briefings. (laughter.) q could we have one? ms. myers: no, i don't think there will be any kind of a formal briefing, but there will be somebody available to answer your questions about it. q did they file a joint form? ms. myers: yes. q when did he file it? ms. myers: i believe it's being filed today. q dee dee, is there going to be a backgrounder for miyazawa? ms. myers: no, there will be a readout after the meeting. q no backgrounder today? ms. myers: no backgrounder today. q this is complicated stuff. we need help. (laughter.) ms. myers: we can't give you taxes and miyazawa all in one day, it's too confusing. (laughter.) q vance and owen have opened the doors on the use of force in bosnia. they've both said that, a, they never ruled it out, and b, it might be necessary now. does that influence your thinking on whether or not to change your approach? ms. myers: there's been no change in our policy towards bosnia. we have always said that we'd consider -- q but does that impact upon your decision? are they people whose opinions would carry weight with you? ms. myers: they're people whose opinions carry weight certainly. i mean, the president supports the process that they've initiated. but there's been no change in our policy for bosnia, although we're considering a number of options right now. if the serbs don't come back to the negotiating table, if they don't sign on to some kind of an agreement, we will consider additional options, which we've been saying regularly. q one follow-up question then? we cannot get a straight answer from anyone in the administration. why do you not set a deadline for the serbs? can you tell us the strategic or tactical reasons for not giving them a deadline to come to the table? ms. myers: we're continuing to put pressure on them every day. q which doesn't work so -- ms. myers: well, we think it is having some effect. we're going to continue to tighten sanctions. as you know, we support the omnibus resolution. we expect that to come to a vote on the 26th. q you say it's having an effect -- can you give us any documentation? ms. myers: i'd be happy to provide somebody to talk to you about the impact of the sanctions and things like that. q there's been no -- you have not been able to provide anybody who can tell us that the sanctions have had any effect in bosnia. serbia, yes; in bosnia, no. ms. myers: i think that they've had effect in serbia and we think they've had some effect in bosnia. and again, i'll be happy to provide somebody to walk you through the details of that, if you'd like. q we would like to hear from someone who can show us what the effect has been in bosnia. we had the briefing on all of the terrible things that are happening in belgrade, but we haven't seen anything that indicates an impact on the fighting. can you provide something along those lines? ms. myers: i will see what i can get you. q on the extra russian aid that christopher announced this morning -- where is that money coming from? ms. myers: we'll have to work with congress on the details of that package. q so that would be new money that you would hope to get? ms. myers: yes, that's new money, in addition to the $1.6 billion announced in vancouver. so i assume that you all have seen the $1.8-billion package that was announced this morning in tokyo by secretary christopher. q isn't there a concern, though, about offering something which you have to get in congress? i mean, that was the concern with vancouver; you didn't want to do that. ms. myers: the concern with vancouver was to do something immediately, which required money that was already approved in the fiscal '93 budget. what we're looking at now is a little bit longer-term plan to build on top of the $1.6 billion that we announced in vancouver. this clearly will require congressional approval, or some of it will anyway, and we're going to continue to work with congress to make that happen. q to what extent has that been vetted or agreed to by congress? ms. myers: the president has had a number of conversations with members and will continue to work with them as this process moves forward. q was christopher able to put this package out with a fair degree of understanding that you will be able to get it through congress? ms. myers: it was created in consultation with congress. q in meeting with the law enforcement officials, is that -- does that have a set speech and a goal? a direction? ms. myers: yes, the president will talk about -- and the law enforcement organizations are endorsing the president's jobs package. they believe particularly the summer jobs package will help give kids something to do. q who are they? ms. myers: it's members or leadership from three organizations: napo, which is the national association of police organizations; ibpo, which is the international brotherhood of police organizations, i believe; and iupa, which is the international union of police associations. q will the fbi chief be there? ms. myers: the fbi chief? no. q or any other federal law enforcement officials? ms. myers: no, it will be the president and these national law enforcement organization leaders. q does the $1.8 billion announced today include the $400 million that's in the fy '94 budget for disarmament? ms. myers: no. the nunn-lugar money is separate. q so this would be the $700 million that's in the budget already, plus another $1.1 billion? ms. myers: i believe all of this is on top of the $700 million already in the budget. q is this going to be part of the supplemental or fiscal '94 -- ms. myers: we'll work with congress on the exact funding mechanism -- on exactly how this will be paid for. q this $1.8 billion on top of -- ms. myers: on top of $700 million -- on top of the $400 million nunn-lugar money we announced earlier. q and this is what prompted the president to call bob dole -- it was on this tranche, not on the previous money he was calling bob dole? ms. myers: correct. q is there a briefing on miyazawa? ms. myers: there will be a readout after the meeting with miyazawa. tomorrow. q dee dee, on a totally unrelated matter, some republicans who are active in the u.s. chamber of commerce are complaining about this new cozy relationship between the white house and the chamber of commerce. there are -- the town hall meeting the other night, the satellite and all of this relationship. does the white house feel that you're getting too close to these chambers of commerce? ms. myers: that's an interesting charge. (laughter.) after how many years of democrats being accused of not paying any attention to the chambers, now there are those who would accuse us of being too close. i think that's interesting. but no, we're thrilled by the support we've received from the national chamber and local chambers across the country and we'll continue to work with them on this and other initiatives. q what's the status of the president thinking about going to this democratic retreat? ms. myers: it's on his calendar. i think he'll almost certainly go. q all three days? ms. myers: we haven't figured out exactly when he'll be there yet. q is it open to coverage? ms. myers: no, i believe the whole thing is closed. q is he going to have any kind of address, statement, anything at all on the gay rights march on the 25th? ms. myers: we're still looking at that. we haven't made a final decision about how we'll -- who will make a statement or what -- q any meetings scheduled with any of the leaders? ms. myers: nothing is scheduled, but i wouldn't rule it out. q what about an aids czar? ms. myers: it's coming. q anything on the weekend? q there's been a suggestion that he's going to this retreat to avoid having to participate in the gay rights -- or appear or have any involvement in the gay rights march. ms. myers: no, i think this is something he's been discussing for a long time -- appearing at the senate democratic retreat. q the weekend? ms. myers: weekend? don't know -- the only thing on right now is the radio address on saturday. q any travel plans? ms. myers: if it changes -- none right now. q he's not going to be off campaigning for his stimulus package? ms. myers: no specific plans right now. q what about mid-week? anything likely? ms. myers: it's possible. yes, i think it's likely that we'll travel next week -- certainly the weekend. q has he called thurmond about his daughter? ms. myers: i don't know. i'll check. q going to name a drug czar this weekend? ms. myers: this weekend? i don't believe so. q and the radio address on saturday -- is that going to be focused on the stimulus package? ms. myers: i'm sure it will. the press: thank you.",

            "i am happy to announce the first public release of the bit program, an interactive, full color image viewer and editor based on sgi gl. besides typical touchup tasks, such as crop, rotate, smooth, etc, bit offers some unique features not available in similar programs, such as text and vector support and the separation of text and image. the following is the relevant sections from the man page. ----------------------------------------------------------------- pre-release of may, 1993 bit(1l) name bit - bitmap image touchup for sgi workstations description bit is an interactive full color image viewer and editor based on silicon graphics gl. as a full color program, bit handles images of both 24bits and color index in a natural and efficient manner. as an image viewer, bit allows list of images to be displayed in their original type (24bits or color index) in any order and in any of the many built-in styles of display. you can walk up and down the list using mouse and keyboard, or you can let bit do the walk for you (the slideshow). with the pan and zoom features, large images can be viewed in full without being limited by the window or screen size. as an image editor, bit performs a large number of image editing and processing tasks accurately and efficiently. it keeps information loss at any stage of the editing process at an absolute minimum by performing subpixel sampling automatically while conserving the input image type whenever possible to avoid unnecessary promotion and/or quantization of input images. you can also cut a piece of an image and paste it into another. in addition, arbitrarily colored and sized text and simple geometric figures can be rendered on top of an image for annotation with the option to make them part of the bitmap or output separately to take advantage of the higher printer resolutions (e.g. postscript). bit can also be used as a graphical user interface to many existing image processing programs by defining external bindings which in essence turn command line oriented programs into bit subfunctions and can be accessed by a press of a button, and best of all, the processed image will be read back and displayed immediately. convolution using exter- nally defined matrices of arbitrary order can be performed dynamically giving great flexibility in processing an image. features bit performs all of its image manipulations interactively with a continuous progress report, and once the processing is complete, the processed image will be displayed. current features include o rotates an image by an arbitrary angle with the option of anti-aliasing and filling the \"rotated out\" region with an arbitrary color. o scales an image by arbitrary factors in x- and/or y-directions with the option of subpixel sampling. o renders text of arbitrary color, size or orientation on top of an image with the option of rendering directly into the raster or saving the text and raster separately, such as into a postscript file, to take advantage of a higher printer resolution. besides normal text strings, many predefined special symbols can be input conveniently as in tex(1), e.g., $\\alpha$\\small$\\beta$ produces greek alphabet alpha followed by a slightly smaller greek alphabet beta. o presents graphically the histogram of an image. o performs arbitrary 1-to-1 pixel transformation. the transformation function can be specified interactively and can be of arbitrary forms. further, the transformation can be applied to rgb channels separately or simultaneously and to the entire image or a portion of it. many difficult tasks, such as thresholding, can be accomplished rather easily by 1-to-1 transformation in combination with the avai- lability of graphical histograms of the image. o places simple geometric figures (sgfs), e.g., arrows, circles, trian- gles etc., of arbitrary color, size and orientation into an image at arbitrary locations addressed either in absolute pixels or in some user definable coordinate system units, with the option of rendering directly into the raster or save the sgfs and raster separately (e.g, postscript file). all sgfs can be scaled in x- and y-directions independently or simultaneously (this is how to get an ellipse from a circle). o performs edge detection. in combination with image histograms and 1- to-1 transformation, very accurate result can be obtained. o performs histogram equalization. o performs convolution with externally defined (square) matrices of arbitrary order. o crops a rectangular portion of an image. o cuts and pastes across images. o magnifies any portion of an image by any amount. o displays a list of images in sequence with a user specifiable pause interval between images. (slideshow) o measures rgb intensities of a pixel at any location or all pixels along an arbitrary line with the result presented as rgb intensities or as an intensity vs. distance plot. o performs image type conversions. o converts image formats. o smoothes an image (special convolution). o filters an image by external programs and read the filtered image back and display it. o modify an individual pixel's rgb values. o performs fft on the entire image or a portion of it and display the resulting power spectra. o spray and brush paint in full color (unavailable in this pre-release). supported formats o iris rgb, native to sgi iris o jpeg(jfif) format o compuserv gif o pnm(portable any map), including ppm, pgm and pbm. o xbm (x window bitmap) o tiff o postscript(write only) hardware requirements: --------------------------------------------------------------- any sgi workstation that supports rgbmode(), including indigoes. where to get it: --------------------------------------------------------------- anonymous ftp to monte.svec.uh.edu /pub/bit/bitxxx.tar.z where xxx is the version number. current version is 0.73 read src/01readme for installation instructions after unpacking acknowledgement: --------------------------------------------------------------- jpeg support is based on the independent jpeg groups's library version 4. forms library, developed by mark overmars, is used for gui. both jpeg and forms library are included in this release. --------------------------------------------------------------- bit is the program you will ever need to view and annotate images; the built-in editing features will satisfy most of your editing needs. in addition, the external filter and dynamical kernel will utilize any program you already have. so try it (and you will like it).",

(by the way, she is 29 or 30 years old). it continued to occur until she had a bald spot about the size of a half dollar. since that time, she has gotten two more bald spots of the same size. other symptoms she's described include: several months of an irregular menstrual cycle (which is strange for her, because she has always been extremely regular); laryngitis every few days -- she will wake up one morning and have almost no voice, and then the next day it's fine; dizzy spells -- she claims that she's had 4 or 5 very bad dizzy spells early in the morning, including one that knocked her to the ground; and general fatigue. she went to a dermatologist first who couldn't find any reason for the symptoms and sent her to an internist who suspected thyroid problems. he did the blood work and claims that everything came back normal. she's very concerned and very confused. does anyone have any ideas or suggestions? i told her that i thought she should see an endocrinologist. does that sound like the right idea? ** by the way, in case you are going to ask...no, she has recently taken any medications that would cause these symptoms...no, she hasn't recently changed her hair products and she hasn't gotten a perm, coloring, or other chemical process that might cause hair to fall out.",

            "a listmember (d andrew killie, i think) wrote, in response to the suggestion that genocide may sometimes be the will of god: > any god who works that way is indescribably evil, > and unworthy of my worship or faith. nobuya \"higgy\" higashiyama replied (as, in substance, did others): > where is your source of moral standards by which you judge god's > behavior? it is often argued that we have no standing by which to judge god's actions. who is the clay to talk back to the potter? but we find a contrary view in scripture. when god proposes to destroy the city of + suppose that there are some good men in the city. + will you destroy the righteous along with the wicked? + far be it from you, lord, to do such a thing! + shall not the judge of all the earth do right? i am told that the hebrew is actually a bit stronger than this, and can perhaps be better rendered (dynamic equivalence) as + shame on you, lord, if you do such a thing! there are those who say that the definition of \"good\" is \"whatever god happens to want.\" but if that is so, then the statement that god is good has no meaning. it simply says that god does what he wants. that being the case, no one can either love or obey god because he is good. the only motive left for obeying him is that he is powerful. just as it makes sense to obey a dictator, even when he tells you to round up all jews and exterminate them, because if you defy him you might end up in the gas chamber yourself, so it makes sense to obey god, because he has the power to punish you if you don't. this ethical theory i take to be in radical contradiction to genesis 18 and to christianity in general. any theory that makes our moral judgements worthless makes any further discussion of morality (or of the goodness of god) meaningless. however, it does not follow that our moral judgements are always infallible in particular cases, still less our judgements in particular cases about the course of action most likely to achieve a good result. when i read the scriptural accounts of the actions of god in history, those actions often seem to me very different from what i might expect of a god who loves us and desires what is best for us. moreover, leaving the scriptures aside, and considering the natural world, i find that nature is often very different from what i might \"those who believe that the author of nature is also the author of the scriptures must expect to find in the scriptures the same sort of difficulties that they find in nature.\") now, that some such difficulties should exist is not in itself an argument against the existence, power, wisdom, and goodness of god. on the contrary, their absence would be such an argument. suppose that i am watching bobby fisher play chess, and suppose that every time he makes a move, i find myself nodding and saying: \"good move! just what i was expecting him to do. same move i would have made if i were playing.\" that would be a sign that fisher is no better a chess player than myself. given that he is better, i expect that at least some of his moves will have me thinking, \"now, what do suppose induced him to do that?\" or even, \"boy, that was a real slip -- he's just thrown the game away!\" similarly, if god understands the workings of the universe better than i do, it is to be expected that sometimes it will look to me as if he has made a mistake. one difference between fisher at the chessboard and god at the controls of the universe is that i can see the end of the chess game. if fisher wins, i revise my earlier inference that it was carelessness that made him lose his queen 23 moves earlier. however, if he loses, and particularly if i can see that there was a time when he had an opportunity for a checkmate in two moves and did not take it, then i know that he is not as good a player as i had thought. with god, on the other hand, i shall not in this life see the total result of some of his actions. therefore, my grounds for judging that i have seen a bad move on his part must always be far shakier than my grounds for making a similar judgement about fisher. ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** in the book of genesis, we read that joseph's ten older brothers, who (with good reason) found him insufferable, conspired to sell him into slavery in egypt. there he eventually became viceroy, and when there was a famine in canaan, he was able to provide for his family. when his brothers nervously apologized, he told them: \"do not worry. you meant to do me evil, but god turned it into good.\" the history of the jews is largely a history of events that look like catastrophes that threaten the continued survival of the religion, or the people, or both. but, amazingly, those events turn out to be the saving of the jews and of judaism. the sale of joseph by his brothers looked like the breakup of the family. but in fact, it ended with a reconciliation of the quarrel between them. the famine that drove the family out of canaan looked like a misfortune for them. but in fact, if they had stayed in canaan, they would almost certainly have intermarried with the canaanites and been assimilated into their culture. their oppression by the egyptians a few generations after their arrival in egypt again looked like a disaster. but god used it to bring them out of egypt, and into the promised land. here the people built a temple, and regularly offered sacrifices. but the babylonians captured jerusalem and judea, destroyed temple and city and countryside, and deported most of the people to babylon. you might have thought that that would be the end of the people and the religion. but it was not. living in canaan, the people had been under constant danger of assimilation. again and again, they had turned from the worship of the lord to the worship of the canaanite fertility cults, with their ritual prostitution and ritual human sacrifice. the babylonian captivity put a stop to that. never again did the jews show any interest in polytheism or idolatry. neither the worship of the canaanites mor that of the babylonians ever again had a foothold among them. nor is that all. judaism had been in danger of becoming simply a system of sacrifices and temple observances. the only prescribed acts of worship consisted of coming to jerusalem every so often and offering a sacrifice. during the captivity, with the temple gone, the jews invented the synagogue, a place of meeting for reading and study and discussion of the scriptures. they came to realize clearly, what they were in danger of forgetting while they continued to live in judea, that god is not simply a local or tribal deity, not just the controller of the land of canaan, or the patron of the jewish people, but the creator of the world, and the ruler and judge of all humans everywhere. time passed, and the babylonian empire was replaced by that of the persians, and then that of the greeks, or rather the macedonians. the ruler, antiochus epiphanes, was determined to stamp out judaism, and to this end he made the reading and the study of the torah punishable by death. again, one might think that this would be the end of judaism. but it was not. the people met for worship, and instead of reading the torah portion appointed for the day, they would read some passage from the prophets that had a similar theme, and then discuss that. before this time, the torah, the so-called five books of moses (genesis, exodus, leviticus, numbers, and deuteronomy) were the only books read and studied in the synagogue. if it had not been for antiochus, the books of the prophets would probably have been forgotten altogether. his hatred for judaism saved them. [other examples here omitted for brevity's sake.] some of you may remember that julie andrews first became famous as eliza doolittle in the stage production of my fair lady. when warner brothers undertook to make a movie of it, everyone expected that julie, who had been so magnificent on stage, would play the same role in the movie. instead, the studio decided to go with an established screen star, and cast audrey hepburn. julie andrews was naturally crushed. but she later realized that if she had played the screen role, she would have been type-cast for life as an elize doolittle type. it would have been a disaster for her. as it was, walt disney offered her the role of mary poppins, and she won an oscar for it. at the presentation, she stood there, smiling, and looking at walt disney, she said, \"and now, my special thanks to the man who made all this possible -- jack warner!\" it was the most memorable line of the evening. in a similar spirit, we jews might thank the men who in the providence of god have preserved judaism, and kept it alive to this day, beginning with joseph's brothers, and continuing with two pharaohs, with nebuchadnezzar, with antiochus epiphanes.... after the formal meeting had broken up, one woman came up to him privately and said, \"you were talking about the holocaust, weren't you?\" he answered, \"if that is an example that came to your mind, then you are right, i was talking about it to you. but i would not talk about it to everyone, for not everyone can bear it.\" i assume that he meant that, without the holocaust, there would have been no state of israel. someone hearing the rabbi's lecture might leap to the conclusion that god is dependent on the wickedness of men to accomplish his purposes -- or at least that the rabbi thought so. he might then go on to suppose that the wickedness is in fact god's doing -- that he stirred up joseph's brothers to a murderous hate against him, and that when the israelites were in egypt, god hardened pharaoh's heart, so that he oppressed the people, and would not let them go. and this raises questions about how an action can be considered wicked and at the same time be considered something that god has brought about. i suggest another way of looking at it. consider a sculptor who has a log of wood from which he proposes to carve a statue. but the log, instead of having a smooth even grain throughout, has a large knot that spoils the appearance of the surface. the sculptor considers the wood for a while, and then carves a statue that features the knot, that makes that particular interruption in the grain and color of the wood correspond to some feature of the statue, so that observers will say: \"how fortunate the sculptor was in finding a piece of wood with a knot like that in just the right place. its presence is the crowning touch, the thing that makes the statue a great work of art.\" in reality, the knot, far from being what the sculptor was looking for, was a challenge to his skill. if the wood had not contained that flaw, he would still have made a great work of art, but a different one. so, if joseph's brothers had not sold him, god would still have brought about his purposes for the jewish people, but he would have done so in another manner. if judas had not betrayed jesus, if caiaphas and his fellow leaders had not rejected jesus, but had rather acknowledged him as the annointed of god, if pilate had followed his conscience rather than his fears and had set jesus free, it might appear that there would have been no crucifixion, and therefore no redemption, and therefore no salvation. not so. god did not need judas' sin to redeem us. if judas had done right, then god in christ would still have reconciled the world to himself. we do not know how, just as we do not know how michelangelo would have painted the sistine chapel if its interior had instead been shaped like grand central station, and just as we do not know how bobby fisher would have won his fourth game agianst spassky if spassky had refused the exchange of bishops and had attacked fisher's knight instead (don't bother to look up the game in question--i am making up this example, but the point is none the less valid). thus, we may say both (1) that god used, say, the cowardice of pilate to accomplish his purposes, and (2) that the said cowardice was not god's doing, and that pilate would not have thwarted god's plans by behaving justly and courageously. what, then, are we to make of the place where god says to moses, \"i will harden pharaoh's heart, so that he will not let the people go\"? some christians have taken this to mean that pharaoh was a puppet with god pulling the strings, and that his stubbornness and cruelty were not his own work, but the work of god in him. i suppose rather that what god was telling moses was something like this: \"if you see that pharaoh is not willing to let the people go, do not be discouraged, or suppose that the situation is out of my control. my purposes will not be thwarted. if pharaoh chooses to hear you and let the people go, well and good. if he does not, i will fit his resistance into my plans, and fit it so perfectly that future historians and theologians will suppose that i would have been thrown for a loss if pharaoh had obeyed me.\" to return to the question that started this all off. is it possible that the serbs, in slaughtering the moslems of bosnia, are instruments of god's will? first point. what they are doing is wrong, just as what joseph's brothers did was wrong, just as what judas did was wrong. they intend it for evil. if god somehow brings good out of it, that does not make them any less subject to just condemnation and punishment. second point. of course, god will bring good out of it. but not the same good that he would have brought if the serbians had refrained from the sins of robbery and rape and murder. nor does the good he purposes excuse us from the duty of doing what is right.",

            "probably we would have much the same problems with only a slight shift in emphasis. weekends might not be so inviolate (more common to work 7 days a week in a business), and instead of american atheists, we would have similar, religious organizations. a persons religious belief seems more as a crutch and justification for actions than a guide to determine actions. of course, people would have to come up with more fascinating rationalizations for their actions, but that could be fun to watch... it seems to me, that for most people, religion in america doesn't matter that much. you have extreemists on both ends, but a large majority don't make too much of an issue about it as long as you don't. now, admittedly, i have never had to suffer the \"bible belt\", but i am just north of it and see the fringes, and the reasonable people in most things tend to be reasonable in religion as well. i don't bother according a higher value to my thinking, or just about anybodys thinking. i don't want to fall in that trap. because if you do start that, then you are then to decide which is better, says whom, why, is there a best, and also what to do about those who have inferior modes of thinking. idic (infinite diversity in infinite combinations.) i'll argue it over a soda, but not over much more. just my $.12 (what inflation has done...)",

            "here is a review of some of the off-ice things that have affected the ahl this year. st john's maple leafs problems the st john's maple leafs sophomore season has been plagued by problems. on-ice, the leafs won the atlantic division title but off ice was less happy. a strike by public workers has forced the leafs out of the newfoundland city for much of the last half of the seaosn (since mid-jan). they have played \"home\" games in places like montreal, cornwall and charlottetown. their playoff \"home\" games will be played in the metro center in halifax, ns. one demostration got violent. workers attacked a leafs' bus and rocked it and broke windows in the st john's memorial stadium. despite the problems, toronto officials insist that the leafs will return to st john's once the strike ends. =================================================== senators sold the new haven senators have been sold by peter shipman to the ottawa senators nhl organization. they are the only canadian nhl team with an american ahl affiliate, and have made it clear they intend to move the team to somewhere in the canadian atlantic provinces. this sale and move has yet to be approved by the ahl head office, but is expected to pass easily at the general meeting in may. the quote in the story from jack butterfield made it clear the league was more interested in the stability of the ahl franchise accompanied by nhl ownership, rather than maintaining the 56-year history of the ahl in new haven. the senators are currently in serious negotiations with charlottetown new brunswick and are expected to move there. ================================================== dallas helps hawks stay in moncton after announcing that they would pull their affiliation out of moncton, the winnipeg jets changed their mind. the jets announced the move when they said that they would be slashing their minor league roster from 20-something to around a dozen; and they wanted to share with an existing ahl or ihl franchise. enter the dallas lone stars. dallas agreed to supply the remaining 6 or 8 players to the moncton franchise. thus keeping the hawks in the new brunswick city. the deal is for one year and will be extended to three years if the season ticket base increases to over 3000. the hawks only sold 1400 for this year. ============================================================ saint john flames official the calgary flames have officially signed a deal with the city of saint john, nb. the saint john blue flames will play in the 6200 exhibition center. the flames still have to apply for an expansion frnachise from the ahl but are expected to have no trouble. ========================================================= caps follow jacks to maine despite rumors to the contrary, the capitals will follow the baltimore skipjacks to maine. the caps' current farm team, the baltimore skipjacks, announced that they would move to maine and become the portland pirates. there was much doubt as to if the caps would follow but they announced a limited deal with portland. they would supply a dozen or so players including 2 goalies. they become the third team to announce a limited farm team along with moncton and the capital district islanders. ====================================================== ahl game of the week in early january, the ahl started a game of the week. the game, produced by, i believe, pyman productions, was televised across the canadian maritimes and northeastern us. the first few weeks saw two games of the week, one in canada and another in the us but since then, there has been only one. sunday afternoon and night games were covered and shown on sportschannel ny and ne in the us and, i believe, atlantic sports network in canada (but i'm not sure about that). i am not sure if playoff games will be covered. ===================================================== utica gone? syracuse added? there were heavy rumors that the utica devils will not be around next season. there were rumors that they might be headed to a midwestern city and that the city of syracuse is trying to lure them. ===================================================== what the ahl might look like next year one option another option northern division southern division adirondack red wings adirondack springfield indians springfield providence bruins providence cd islanders cdi portland pirates hershey binghamton southern division rochester hershey bears hamilton binghamton rangers utica rochester americans hamilton canucks atlantic division utica (?) devils portland st john's atlantic division saint john st john's maple leafs moncton moncton hawks halifax halifax citadels fredericton cape breton oilers cape breton fredericton canadiens charlottetown saint john blue flames charlottetown senators (move is unofficial as yet)",

            "reading from a amoco performance products data sheet, their erl-1906 resin with t40 carbon fiber reinforcement has a compressive strength of 280,000 psi. it has a density of 0.058 lb/cu in, therefore the theoretical height for a constant section column that can just support itself is 4.8 million inches, or 400,000 ft, or 75 statute miles. now, a real structure will have horizontal bracing (either a truss type, or guy wires, or both) and will be used below the crush strength. let us assume that we will operate at 40% of the theoretical strength. this gives a working height of 30 miles for a constant section column. a constant section column is not the limit on how high you can build something if you allow a tapering of the cross section as you go up. for example, let us say you have a 280,000 pound load to support at the top of the tower (for simplicity in calculation). this requires 2.5 square inches of column cross sectional area to support the weight. the mile of structure below the payload will itself weigh 9,200 lb, so at 1 mile below the payload, the total load is now 289,200 lb, a 3.3% increase. the next mile of structure must be 3.3% thicker in cross section to support the top mile of tower plus the payload. each mile of structure must increase in area by the same ratio all the way to the bottom. we can see from this that there is no theoretical limit on area, although there will be practical limits based on how much composites we can afford to by at $40/lb, and how much load you need to support on the ground (for which you need a foundation that the bedrock can support. let us arbitrarily choose $1 billion as the limit in costruction cost. with this we can afford perhaps 10,000,000 lb of composites, assuming our finished structure costs $100/lb. the $40/lb figure is just for materials cost. then we have a tower/payload mass ratio of 35.7:1. at a 3.3% mass ratio per mile, the tower height becomes 111 miles. this is clearly above the significant atmosphere. a rocket launched from the top of the tower will still have to provide orbital velocity, but atmospheric drag and g-losses will be almost eliminated. g-losses are the component of rocket thrust in the vertical direction to counter gravity, but which do not contribute to horizontal orbital velocity. thus they represent wasted thrust. together with drag, rockets starting from the ground have a 15% velocity penalty to contend with. this analysis is simplified, in that it does not consider wind loads. these will require more structural support over the first 15 miles of height. above that, the air pressure drops to a low enough value for it not to be a big factor. dani eder",

            "stuff deleted i reiterate that i would agree with you that there is little justification for the punishment of apostasy in the qur'an. in islamic history, as well, apostasy has rarely been punished. belief is considered a matter of conscience and since there is to be no compulsion in the matter of belief, apostates have been generally left to believe or not believe as they will. however, when an apostate makes attacks upon \"god and his messenger\" the situation changes. now the charge of apostasy may be complicated with other charges - perhaps charges of sedition, treason, spying, etc. if the person makes a public issue of their apostasy or mounts public attacks (as opposed to arguement) against islam, the situation is likewise complicated. if the person spreads slander or broadcasts falsehoods, again the situation changes. the punishments vary according to the situation the apostate is in. anyhow, the charge of aggravated apostasy would only be a subsidiary charge in rushdie's case. there is a distinction in the qur'an between a formal war situation and being in the situation where someone unilaterally wages war (by their actions), creates disorder, makes mischief,etc. against the muslims and creates a situation that results in harm to muslims. here, a small group or even a single individual could be said to be engaged in such a practise. in other words, there is a clear difference between a formal war situation (where two clearly defined parties wage war, conclude treaties, exchange prisoners, etc.), and dealing with attacks that come from isolated individuals or groups against islam. it is the second situation, the unilateral attack and the spreading of \"fasad\" that would apply in the case of rushdie. the matter of rushdie is not a simple matter of banning an offensive book (banning the book is secondary) - a full set of circumstances following the publication of the book come into play as well, including the deaths of many muslims, and rushdie's (and his publishers) media games. i am not sure which hadith you are referring to above. i believe that one of the qur'anic verses on which the fatwa is based is 5:33. every verse in the qur'an has a corresponding \"circumstance of revelation\" but in no way is the understanding (the tafsir) of the verse restricted solely to the particular historical circumstance in which it was revealed. if this was the case then we could say that all the laws and regulations that were revealed when the muslims were not involved in conflict, should be suspended when they were at war. the logic does not follow. in complex, real-life situations, there may be many verses and many hadiths which can all be related to a single, complicated situation. the internal relationships between these verses may be quite complex, such that arriving at an understanding of how the verses interlock and how each applies to the particular situation can be quite a demanding task. it is not necessarily a simple \"this or that\" process. there may be many parameters involved, there may be a larger context in which a particular situation should be viewed. all these matters impinge on the situation. in other words there is a great deal involved in deciphering the qur'an. the qur'an asks us to reflect on its verses, but this reflection must entail more than simply reading a verse and its corresponding hadith. if the reflection is for the sake of increasing personal piety, then each person has his own level of understanding and there is no harm in that. however, if the reflection is in order to decide matters that pertain to the state, to the gestation of laws and rulings, to the gestation of society, the dispensing of justice, the guidance of the community, then there are certain minimum requirements of understanding that one should achieve. jaffar ibn muhammad as-sadiq(a.s.) relates some of these requirements, as taught by the prophet(s.a.), in a hadith: \"...he who does not distinguish in the book of allah the abrogating verse from the abrogated one, and a specific one from a general one, and a decisive from an ambiguous; and does not differentiate between a permission and an obligation, and does not recognize a verse of meccan period from a medinite one, and does not know the circumstances of revelation, and does not understand the technical words of the qur'an (whether simple or compound); and does not comprehend the knowledge of decree and measure, and is ignorant of advancing and delaying (in its verses); and does not distinguish the clear from the deep, nor the manifest from the esoteric, nor the beginning from the termination; and is unaware of the question and the answer, the disjoining and the joining, and the exceptions and the all-inclusive, and is ignorant of an adjective of a preceding noun that explains the subsequent one; and is unaware of the emphasized subject and the detailed one, the obligatory laws and the permissions, the places of the duties and rules, and the meaning of the lawful and the unlawful; and does not know the joined words, and the words that are related to those coming before them, or after them - then such a man does not know the qur'an; nor is he among the people of the qur'an....\". based on these and other hadiths, and in accordance with many qur'anic verses (\"why should not a company from every group remain behind to gain profound understanding (tafaqquh) in religion and to warn people when they return to them, so that they may beware.\" (9:122)), a science of jurisprudence arose. the requirements for a person to be considered a mujtahid (one who can pronounce on matters of law and religion) are many. i've listed a few major divisions below - there are, of course, many subdivisions within these headings. - knowledge of arabic (syntax, conjugation, roots, semantics, oratory). - knowledge of tafsir and principles of tafsir. - logic (mantiq) - a knowledge of hadiths - a knowledge of transmitters (rijal) - knowledge of the principles of juriprudence (qur'an, sunnah, consensus, reasoning) the study of qur'an and sunnah for purposes of law involves: - discussion of imperatives (awamir) - discussion of negative imperatives (nawahi) - discussion of generalities and particularities (aam wa khas) - discussion of unconditional and conditional - discussion of tacit meanings - discussion of the abstract and the clear - discussion of the abrogator and the abrogated the principles of application of the law involves: - principles of exemption - principles of precaution - principles of option - principles of mastery the jurisprudent is bound to go through a very rigorous process in pronouncing judgement on a given situation. it is not a matter of looking at one verse and one hadith. now no one should blindly follow anyone, but there is a difference between blind following and acceding to the opinion of someone who is clearly more knowledgeable and more qualified than oneself. there is the \"the fuqaha (religious scholars) are the trustees of the prophet, as long as they do not concern themselves with the illicit desires, pleasures, and wealth of this world.\" the prophet (s.a.) was asked: \"o messenger of god! how may we know if they so concern themselves?\" he (s.a.) replied: \"by seeing whether they follow the ruling power. if they do that, fear for your religion and shun them.\" i do not yet know enough about the imams of the four sunni madhabs to comment on how this hadith applies to them or to the contemporary scholars who base themselves upon them. the prophet also refered to the fuqaha as \"the fortress of islam\". my only point is to make it clear that arriving at a legal judgement calls into play a certain amount of expertise - the specifics of this expertise is delineated in the qur'an and hadith. those who acquire this expertise are praised in both the qur'an and hadith - those who without the requisite knowledge pronounce on matters that affect society, state, and religion are cautioned. the only reason i said anything at all about the rushdie affair in this group, is because the whole basis for the discussion of the fatwa (that is, apostasy), was wrong. when one discusses something they should at least base their discussion on fact. secondly, khomeini was condemned as a heretic because he supposedly claimed to be infallible - another instance of creating a straw man and then beating him. i agree that we should move the discussion to another newsgroup. unfortunately, i do not have any access to email, so private discussion or a moderated group is out of the question (i cannot post to a moderated group like soc.religion.islam. how about soc.culture.arabic or talk.religion.misc?",

            "here is some material by michael davies on the subject of schism in general and archishop lefebvre in particular. he wrote it around 1990. the first part of the two-part article was on the scandalous activities of archbishop weakland (in this country), but i cut all that. and i pared down the rest to what was relevant. joe buehler ... schism and disobedience according to st. thomas aquinas, schism consists primarily in a refusal of submission to the pope or communion with the members of the church united to him. on first sight it would appear that, whatever the subjective motivation of the archbishop, as discussed above, he must be in a state of objective schism as he has refused to submit to the pope on a very grave matter involving his supreme power of jurisdiction. however, standard catholic textbooks of theology make it clear that while all schisms involve disobedience not all acts of disobedience are schismatic. if this were so, as was noted at the beginning of this article, it would mean that the number of american bishops who are not schismatic would not reach double figures. the distinction between disobedience and schism is made very clear in the article on schism in the very authoritative dictionnaire de theologie catholique. the article is by father yves congar who is certainly no friend of archbishop lefebvre. he explains that schism and disobedience are so similar that they are often confused. father congar writes that schism involves a refusal to accept the existence of legitimate authority in the church, for example, luther's rejection of the papacy. father congar explains that the refusal to accept a decision of legitimate authority in a particular instance does not constitute schism but disobedience. the catholic encyclopedia explains that for a catholic to be truly schismatic he would have to intend \"to sever himself from the church as far as in him lies.\" it adds that \"not every disobedience is schism; in order to possess this character it must include besides the transgression of the command of the superiors, a denial of their divine right to command.\"not only does mgr. lefebvre not deny the divine right of the pope to command, but he affirms repeatedly his recognition of the pope's authority and his intention of never breaking away from rome. the archbishop made his attitude clear in the july/august 1989 issue of 30 days: \"we pray for the pope every day. nothing has changed with the consecrations last june 30. we are not sedevacantists. we recognize in john paul ii the legitimate pope of the catholic church. we don't even say that he is a heretical pope. we only say that his modernist actions favor heresy.\" ... intrinsically schismatic? the principal argument used by those claiming that mgr. lefebvre is in schism is that the consecration of a bishop without a papal mandate is an intrinsically schismatic act. a bishop who carries out such a consecration, it is claimed, becomes ipso facto a schismatic. this is not true. if such a consecration is an intrinsically schismatic act it would always have involved the penalty of excommunication. in the 1917 code of canon law the offence was punished only by suspension (see canon 2370 of the 1917 code). pope pius xii had raised the penalty to excommunication as a response to the establishment of a schismatic church in china. the consecration of these illicit chinese bishops differed radically from the consecrations carried out by mgr. lefebvre as the professed intention was to repudiate the authority of the pope, that is, to deny that he has the right to govern the church, and the illicitly consecrated chinese bishops were given a mandate to exercise an apostolic mission. neither archbishop lefebvre nor any of the bishops he has consecrated claim that they have powers of jurisdiction. they have been consecrated solely for the purpose of ensuring the survival of the society by carrying out ordinations and also to perform confirmations. i do not wish to minimize in any way the gravity of the step take by mgr. lefebvre. the consecration of bishops without a papal mandate is far more serious matter than the ordination of priests as it involves a refusal in practice of the primacy or jurisdiction belonging by divine right to the roman pontiff. but the archbishop could argue that the crisis afflicting the church could not be more grave, and that grave measures were needed in response. it appears to be taken for granted by most of the archbishop's critics that he was excommunicated for the offense of schism, and the vatican has certainly been guilty of fostering this impression. there is not so much as a modicum of truth in this allegation. the new code of canon law includes a section beginning with canon 1364 entitled \"penalties for specific offenses\" (de poenis in singula dicta). the first part deals with \"offenses against religion and the unity of the church\" (de delictis contra religionem et ecclesiae unitatem). canon 1364 deals with the offense of schism which is, evidently, together with apostasy and heresy, one of the three fundamental offenses against the unity of the church. but the archbishop was not excommunicated under the terms of this canon or, indeed, under any canon involving an offense against religion or the unity of the church. the canon cited in his excommunication comes from the third section of \"penalties for specific offenses\" which is entitled \"usurpation of ecclesial functions and offenses in their exercise\" (de munerum ecclesiasticorum usurpatione degue delictis iniis exercendis). the canon in question is canon 1382, which reads: \"a bishop who consecrates someone bishop and the person who receives such a consecration from a bishop without a pontifical mandate incur an automatic (latae sententiae) excommunication reserved to the holy see.\" the scandalous attempts to smear archbishop lefebvre with the offense of schism are, then, contrary to both truth and charity. a comparable smear under civil as opposed to ecclesiastical law would certainly justify legal action for libel involving massive damages. an accurate parallel would be to state that a man convicted of manslaughter had been convicted of first degree murder. i must stress that what i have written here is not the dubious opinion of laymen unversed in the intricacies of canon law. canon lawyers without the least shred of sympathy for mgr. lefebvre have repudiated the charge of schism made against him as totally untenable. father patrick yaldrini, dean of the faculty of canon law of the institut catholique in paris noted in the 4 july 1988 issue of valeurs actuelles that, as i have just explained, mgr. lefebvre was not excommunicated for schism but for the usurpation of an ecclesiastical function. he added that it is not the consecration of a bishop which constitutes schism but the conferral of an apostolic mission upon the illicitly consecrated bishop. it is this usurpation of the powers of the sovereign pontiff which proves the intention of establishing a parallel church. cardinal rosalio lara, president of the pontifical commission for the authentic interpretation of canon law, commented on the consecrations in the 10 july 1988 issue of la repubblica. it would be hard to the act of consecrating a bishop (without a papal mandate) is not in itself a schismatic act. in fact, the code that deals with offenses is divided into two sections. one deals with offenses against religion and the unity of the church, and these are apostasy, schism, and heresy. consecrating a bishop with a pontifical mandate is, on the contrary, an offense against the exercise of a specific ministry. for example, in the case of the consecrations carried out by the vietnamese archbishop ngo dinh thuc in 1976 and 1983, although the archbishop was excommunicated he was not considered to have committed a schismatic act because there was no intention of a breach with the church. .... it is not simply unjust but ludicrous to suggest that in consecrating bishops without a papal mandate archbishop lefebvre had the least intent of establishing a schismatic church. he is not a schismatic and will never be a schismatic. the archbishop considers correctly that the the church is undergoing its worst crisis since the arian heresy, and that for the good of the church it was necessary for him to consecrate the four bishops to ensure the future of his society. canon law provides for just such a situation, and even if one believes that the future of the society could have been guaranteed without these consecrations, the fact that the archbishop believed sincerely that it could not means, as canon law states clearly, that he has not incurred excommunication. furthermore, while the vatican allows such prelates as archbishop weakland to undermine the faith with impunity it cannot expect catholics to pay the least attention to its sanctions against a great and orthodox archbishop whose entire life has been devoted to the service of the church and the salvation of souls. dr. eric m. de saventhem, president of the international una voce association, is one of the best informed laymen in the church, and he knows the archbishop intimately. dr. de saventhem, like myself, has no greater desire than to see a reconciliation between mgr. lefebvre and the holy see during the archbishop's lifetime. a quotation from a statement by dr. de saventhem which was published in the 15 february 1989 remnant merits careful study:",

[...] kirlian photography has shown how water mentally 'charged' by a healer has a much richer energy field around it than ordinary water... from the incredulous side: [macrobert, alan, \"reality shopping; a consumer's guide to new age hokum.\", _whole earth review_, autumn 1986, vnon4 p4(11). an excellent article providing common-sense guidelines for evaluating paranormal claims, and some of the author's favorite examples of hokum.] the crank usually works in isolation from everyone else in his field of study, making grand discoveries in his basement. many paranormal movements can be traced back to such people -- kirlian photography, for instance. if you pump high-voltage electricity into anything it will emit glowing sparks, common knowledge to electrical workers and hobbyists for a century. it took a lone basement crank to declare that the sparks represent some sort of spiritual aura. in fact, kirlian photography was subjected to rigorous testing by physicists john o. pehek, harry j. kyler, and david l. faust, who reported their findings in the october 15, 1976, issue of science. their conclusion: the variations observed in kirlian photographs are due solely to moisture on the surface of the body and not to mysterious \"auras\" or even necessarily to changes in mood or mental state. nevertheless, television shows, magazines, and books (many by famous parapsychologists) continue to promote kirlian photography as proof of the unknown.",

(...) a short time ago i was in command of a veteran team, in which some of the fellows applied for release from the cherry. we called such soldiers h.i. 'hit by the intifada'. under my command was a soldier who talked to himself non-stop, which is a common phenomenon in the cherry. i sent him to a psychiatrist. but why i should talk about others when i myself feel quite insane ? on fridays, when i come home, my parents know i cannot be talked to until i go to the beach, surf a little, calm down and return. the keys of my father's car must be ready for in advance, so that i can go there. i they dare talk to me before, or whenever i don't want them to talk to me, i just grab a chair and smash it instantly. i know it is my nerve: smashing chairs all the time and then running away from home, to the car and to the beach. only there i become normal.(...) (...) another friday i was eating a lunch prepared by my mother. it was an omelette of sorts. she took the risk of sitting next to me and talking to me. i then told my mother about an event which was still fresh in my mind. i told her how i shot an arab, and how exactly his wound looked like when i went to inspect it. she began to laugh hysterically. i wanted her to cry, and she dared laugh straight in my face instead ! so i told her how my pal had made a mincemeat of the two arabs who were preparing the molotov cocktails. he shot them down, hitting them beautifully, exactly as they deserved. one bullet had set a molotov cocktail on fire, with the effect that the arab was burning all over, just beautifully. i was delighted to see it. my pal fired three bullets, two at the arab with the molotov cocktail, and the third at his chum. it hit him straight in his ass. we both felt that we'd pulled off something. next i told my mother how another pal of mine split open the guts in the belly of another arab and how all of us ran toward that spot to take a look. i reached the spot first. and then that arab, blood gushing forth from his body, spits at me. i yelled: 'shut up' and he dared talk back to me in hebrew! so i just laughed straight in his face. i am usually laughing when i stare at something convulsing right before my eyes. then i told him: 'all right, wait a moment'. i left him in order to take a look at another wounded arab. i asked a soldier if that arab could be saved, if the bleeding from his artery could be stopped with the help of a stone of something else like that. i keep telling all this to my mother, with details, and she keeps laughing straight into my face. this infuriated me. i got very angry, because i felt i was becoming mad. so i stopped eating, seized the plate with he omelette and some trimmings still on, and at once threw it over her head. only then she stopped laughing. at first she didn't know what to say. (...) but i must tell you of a still other madness which falls upon us frequently. i went with a friend to practice shooting on a field. a gull appeared right in the middle of the field. my friend shot it at once. then we noticed four deer standing high up on the hill above us. my friend at once aimed at one of them and shot it. we enjoyed the sight of it falling down the rock. we shot down two deer more and went to take a look. when we climbed the rocks we saw a young deer, badly wounded by our bullet, but still trying to such some milk from its already dead mother. we carefully inspected two paths, covered by blood and chunks of torn flesh of the two deer we had hit. we were just delighted by that sight. we had hit'em so good ! then we decided to kill the young deer too, so as spare it further suffering. i approached, took out my revolver and shot him in the head several times from a very short distance. when you shoot straight at the head you actually see the bullets sinking in. but my fifth bullet made its brains fall outside onto the ground, with the effect of splattering lots of blood straight on us. this made us feel cured of the spurt of our madness. standing there soaked with blood, we felt we were like beasts of prey. we couldn't explain what had happened to us. we were almost in tears while walking down from that hill, and we felt the whole day very badly. (...) we always go back to places we carried out assignments in. this is why we can see them. when you see a guy you disabled, may be for the rest of his life, you feel you got power. you feel godlike of sorts.\" (...) both danny and dudu contemplate at least at this moment studying the acting. dudu is not willing to work in any security-linked occupation. danny feels the exact opposite. 'why shouldn't i take advantage of the skills i have mastered so well ? why shouldn't i earn $3.000 for each chopped head i would deliver while being a mercenary in south africa ? this kind of job suits me perfectly. i have no human emotions any more. if i get a reasonable salary i will have no problem to board a plane to bosnia in order to fight there.\"",
            "the following is what they feed to us..... most has been posted already, but there are a number of items not seen here yet..... redesign activities update -- following is the weekly status on redesign, based on information provided by nasa headquarters. the station redesign team (srt) provided a detailed status report to the advisory committee on the redesign of the space station on april 22. the day-long meeting was held in anser facilities in crystal city, va; topics covered by the srt included a preliminary mission and goals statement for the space station; science, technology and engineering research; the assessment process; and the design approach. discussions on management options and operations concepts also were held. the design teams then presented the three options under study: \u00a5 option a - modular buildup -- pete priest presented the a option. priest said the team is working to define a station that meets cost goals and has identified three distinct phases of evolution - power station, human tended and permanent presence. the team will define the minimum capability needed to achieve each phase, the total cost of each phase and the achievable capability for budget levels. the a option uses current or simplified freedom hardware where cost effective and is considering other existing systems such as the so-called \"bus-1 spacecraft,\" the orbiter and spacelab. the power station capability could be achieved in 3 flights with freedom photo voltaic modules providing 20 kw of power. 30-day shuttle/spacelab missions docked to the power station are assumed for this phase. human tended capability would be provided by the addition of the u.s. common module module which adds subsystems and 9 payload racks and docking ports for esa and japanese laboratories. 60-day missions with the orbiter docked to the station are assumed for this phase. different operation/utilization modes are being studied for this phase. \u00a5 option b - freedom derived -- mike griffin presented the status of option b activities. griffin detailed the evolution of the freedom-derived option, from initial research capability, to human-tended capability, to permanent human presence capability, to two fault tolerance, and finally permanent human capability. griffin also outlined proposed systems changes to the baseline program, with minor changes to the communications and tracking system, crew health care system and eclss, and a major change to the data management system. initial research capability would be achieved with 2 flights to 28.5 degree inclination (3 flights to 51.6 degrees) and consist of an extended duration orbiter-spacelab combination docked to a truss segment with 2 photo voltaic arrays providing 18.75 kw of power. human-tended capability would be achieved in 6 flights and add truss segments and the u.s. lab. permanent human presence capability would be achieved in 8 flights with two orbiters providing habitation and assured crew return. two fault tolerance, achieved in 11 flights, would build out the other section of truss with another set of pv modules, thermal control and propulsion systems. the freedom derived configuration could achieve an international complete state with 16 flights. three more flights, to bring up the habitat module, a third pv array and two assured crew return vehicles (acrv) would complete the permanent human capability with international stage. griffin told the redesign advisory committee that eliminating hardware would not, by itself, meet budget guidelines for the freedom derived option. major reductions or deferrals must occur in other areas including program management, contractor non-hardware, early utilization and operations costs, he said. \u00a5 option c - singe launch core station -- chet vaughn presented option c, the single launch core station concept. a shuttle external tank and solid rocket boosters would be used to launch the station into orbit. shuttle main engines would be mounted to the tail of the station module for launch and jettisoned after et separation. the module, 23 feet in diameter and 92 feet long, would provide 26,000 cubic feet of pressured volume, separated into 7 \"decks\" connected by a centralized passageway. seven berthing ports would be located at various places on the circumference of the module to place the international modules, and other elements. this \"can\" would have two fixed photo voltaic arrays producing approximately 40 kw of power flying in a solar interial attitude. in his closing comments to the redesign advisory committee, bryan o'connor said a design freeze would be established for the 3 options on april 26 so that detailed costing of the options can begin. the next meeting with the redesign advisory committee will be may 3. russian consultants arrive in u.s. -- a delegation of 16 russian space experts arrived in the u.s. on april 21 and briefings to the srt by members of the russian team began on the 22nd. the group includes russian space agency general director y. m. koptev, and v. a. yatsenko, also of the rsa. others on the team include representatives from the ministry of defense, the design bureau salyut, the institute of biomedical problems, the ministry of foreign affairs, npo energia and tsnijmash. the russian team briefed the srt on environmental control and life support system, docking systems, the proton launch vehicle, mir operations and utilization, and the soyuz tm spacecraft. the russian consultants are available to the srt to assess the capabilities of the mir space station, and the possible use of mir and other russian capabilities and systems as part of the space station redesign. they will be available to the srt through may 5. management and operations review continues -- work continued in the srt subgroups. the management group under dr. walt brooks is working to develop a family of options that solve the current problems and build a foundation for the transition to development and operations. various management options have been developed including: \u00a5 lead center with the center director in the programmatic chain of command. \u00a5 host center with the program manager reporting directly to an associate administrator. \u00a5 skunk works/dedicated program office with a small dedicated co-located hand-picked program office. \u00a5 combine space station with shuttle, with the space station becoming an element of the current program. \u00a5 major tune up to current organization, with current contracts and geographical distribution maintained but streamlined. the operations group under dr. john cox is building on the work of the operations phase assessment team lead by gene kranz of nasa-jsc, which had already begun a comprehensive review of operations and had concluded in its preliminary results that significant cost reductions are possible. as part of its work, the operations group has identified teams of agency experts to develop detailed evaluations of each design in the areas of assembly and operations, utilization, maintenance and logistics and testing and ground operations. what's in the week ahead? -- the design support teams will provide a comprehensive status of their option to the station redesign team on monday and tuesday at which point the design will be \"frozen\" to begin the detailed cost assessment. also this week, the team will begin preparing for the next round of discussions with the redesign advisory committee, to be held may 3. dr. shea steps down -- dr. joe shea stepped down as director of the station redesign team on april 22 and bryan o'connor will take over the activities of the team. dr. shea submitted his resignation as assistant deputy administrator for space station analysis, but will continue to serve as a special advisory to nasa administrator goldin and be available to consult with the srt. mr goldin accepted the resignation so that a request from dr. shea to reduce his workload could be accommodated. key milestones -- the key dates for the srt as they are currently being carried on the schedule are: april 26 design freeze on options for costing april 27 design support team present selected options to srt may 3 status report to redesign advisory committee may 15 interim report by redesign advisory committee june 7 final report to redesign advisory committee",

            "it was unlikely, improbable. for the bruins, it was the stuff of nightmares; for the sabres, it was a taste of heaven. for the first time since 1983, the sabres have won the first three games of a series. last time was a three games to none victory in a best of five against the canadiens. it takes a little more work this time. the sabres seem ready to put in the extra work. on the heels of a shutout, one that took away boston's home ice advantage, the sabres came back with a four to three overtime win. it wasn't easy. it wasn't always pretty. it still worked. john blue got the nod for boston, supplanting andy moog as starting goaltender. moog was pulled midway through game 2 on tuesday. buffalo started with a goal by mogilny, his fourth of the playoffs, on the powerplay, with boston's don sweeney and gord roberts in the box. lafontaine and hawerchuk had the assists. goal number two was khmylev's first of the playoffs, a pretty goal scored when the sabres stole the puck and passed to an open and waiting khmylev. smehlik and hannan assisted. determined not to be shut out, boston tallied on a shot by ray bourque on the powerplay, with colin patterson and bob sweeney both in the box. period two was scoreless, a split of penalties between the two clubs. the third saw boston's smolinski get his first, courtesy of oates. buffalo resecured the lead two minutes later, from former bruin bob sweeney (khmylev and carney). neely tied the game 3/4 of the way through the third, sending it into overtime. last year overtime meant a bruin win. last night, it spelled sweet revenge, as buffalo scored with ray bourque in the penalty box, on a tip in by khmylev (hawerchuk and lafontaine) a minute into overtime. both teams finished with 34 shots. power-play conversions--boston 5-1. buffalo 7-2. referee--rob shick. comments: shick pocketed the whistle in the third, allowing a lot of clutching and grabbing. buffalo's penalty killing unit was fantastic again. mogilny was checking. granted he missed once and instead flung his body into the boards, but checking like this is a novel idea to mogilny. the crowd was unbelievable. i don't think i've ever heard a crowd that loud in the aud for a sabres game (remember, i was only five when they played for the cup. i don't remember it and no one took me to the games). doug bodger, in a postgame interview, noted that he tried to say something to hawerchuk, but the crowd was too loud, even though he was shouting. it didn't seem to matter, as most of the sabres and even muckler said it was great. yuri khmylev didn't seem to realize that he was the game's third star and didn't skate out when his name was called. sweeney (2) and fuhr (1) each were out before yuri made his appearance, sans jersey. when asked in an interview later whether he knew how big a goal that was, he responed yes (ok, it was through an interpreter and he said more than that, even more than the interpreter said, but i digress). the interviewer seemed to think just because he doesn't speak english, he must not understand playoffs. uh-huh.",

            "i have owned my sprint from the beginning and that sensor light comes on every 30k to let you know it's time for a check up. when that light goes on, i just take it to the delaer tell them \"it's that time\" and they work on it for 4 hou and you pay $5 for parts and $100 for labor. (ahh...what they get for labor) i currently have about 95k on my sprint and of all the times i took it in for service, i never say on the payment sheet anything about the replacement of the oxygen sensor. what the heck is an oxygen sensor? as far an i know of, i have never had that thing replaced in my car and the car is purring like a kitten. now, i don't have a/c (mother nature does that for me :-) ) and that might have something to do with it, but i still never heard of an oxygen sensor. the only major service job i have had on my car (besides getting the tires replaced if you want to call that a service job) was getting the rotor, distributor and gasket replaced. and that was all done within the past 2 months. what i do at 30k is have a good tune-up, let them replace what ever they need to, pay the bill (about $125) and go home and don't worry about the car for another 30k. oh, i just remembered something. if that little sensor light bothers you, in the fuse box right below the turn-signal lever up against the dash, there is a swith on the right side. flip that switch and the light will go off. i do that so that little light won't annoy me. if you can't find it, look it up in the car manuel. i hope that i have helped a little and good luck with the _oxygen sensor_? - thomas -",

            "[...] henrik] country. turks and azeris consistantly want to drag armenia into the henrik] karabakh conflict with azerbaijan. bm] gimme a break. capital letters, or not, the above is pure nonsense. it bm] seems to me that short sighted armenians are escalating the hostilities ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ henrik] again, armenians in karabakh are simply defending themselves. what do henrik] want them to do. lay down their arms and let azeris walk all over them. news reports i've seen say otherwise both location and motives wise. caps don't change facts. bm] while hoping that turkey will stay out. stop and think for a moment, bm] will you? armenia doesn't need anyone to drag her into the conflict, it bm] is a part of it. henrik] armenians knew from the begining that turks were fully engaged henrik] training azeris militarily to fight against karabakhi-armenians. so? should i, at this point break into caps and start talking about defense etc.? i don't know how 'fully engaged' turkey is/was though. henrik] the karabakhi-armenians who have lived in their homeland for 3000 henrik] years (cut off from armenia and given to azeris by stalin) are the henrik] ones directly involved in the conflict. they are defending henrik] themselves against azeri aggression. bm] huh? you didn't expect azeri's to be friendly to forces fighting with them bm] within their borders? henrik] well, history is sad. remember, those are relocated azeris into henrik] the armenian land of karabakh by the stalin regime. so i hear. this justifies bloodshed n years after the fact? henrik] at last, i hope that the u.s. insists that turkey stay out of the henrik] karabakh crisis so that the repeat of the cyprus invasion will never henrik] occur again. bm] you're not playing with a full deck, are you? where would turkey invade? henrik] it is not up to me to speculate but i am sure turkey would have stepped henrik] into armenia if she could. why would turkey do that? do you not realize that this is a local clash that turkey never wished to see happen? turkey has other plans for region, like economic revival, co-operation etc. good stuff in other words, i'd be happy to bicker with armenians over trade barriers and such on usenet rather than 'who killed whom in what way' which i detest doing and wouldn't do. bm] are you throwing the cyprus buzzword around with s.c.g. in the header bm] in hopes that the greek netters will jump the gun? henrik] absolutely not ! i am merely trying to emphasize that in many henrik] cases, history repeats itself. even if one buys into your implicit premise, the sane thing to do would be to try not to provoke turkey as was done in '74. if there'd been a democratic government instead of a bunch of idiots in athens at the time, everybody would have stayed home with their families. [i have no wish to go into the cyprus quarrel, but i suspect what i've said is not only accurate but also palatable to all parties involved] bm] yes indeed turkey has the military prowess to intervene, what she wishes bm] she had, however, is the diplomatic power to stop the hostilities and bring bm] the parties to the negotiating table. that's hard to do when armenians bm] are attacking azeri towns. henrik] so, let me understand in plain words what you are saying; turkey henrik] wants a peaceful end to this conflict. not !! so what do you think we want? war, death and destruction? henrik] i will believe it when i see it. no, if you allow yourself to believe it you just might see it. henrik] now, as far as attacking, what do you do when you see a gun pointing henrik]to your head ? do you sit there and watch or defend yoursef(fat chance)? this kind of childish rhetoric doesn't help anthing. henrik] do you remember what azeris did to the armenians in baku ? all the henrik] barberian acts especially against mothers and their children. i mean henrik] burning people alive ! now, some azeri will come out and give a description of similar stuff perpetrated by armenians. one should re-hash stuff like this often to keep the hatred alive, right? bm] armenian leaders are lacking the statesmanship to recognize the bm]futility of armed conflict and convince their nation that a compromise that bm] leads to stability is much better than a military faits accomplis that's bm] going to cause incessant skirmishes. henrik] armenians in karabakh want peace and their own republic. they are henrik] not asking much. they simply want to get back what was taken away henrik] from them and given to azeris by stalin. well they obviously aren't getting anywhere with their current methods of asking (not very peaceful i'd say). bm] think of 10 or 20 years down the line -- both of the newly independent bm] countries need to develop economically and neither one is going to wipe bm] the other out. these people will be neighbors, would it not be better bm] to keep the bad blood between them minimal? henrik] don't get me wrong. i also want peaceful solution to the henrik] conflict. but until azeris realize that, the armenians in henrik] karabakh will defend themselves against aggresion. i don't know if you want a solution or just want to exchange slogans. peace isn't what's happening right now, furthermore what's happening right now isn't condusive to peace. you can spend days and nights raving about how 'right' the armenian position is and i'm sure there'll be others who'd be happy to talk to you by arguing the other side. if entrenched positions lead to war, and if people want peace than they should sit down and talk about a compromise. armenia isn't strong enough to exercise the 'we think we're right, and we have the bombs, so we'll do whatever we want, so there...' style of foreign relations. yes you can type stalin in caps, and give one sided atrocity stories etc. but for peace you need to be willing to talk to the other side. you personally can choose not to do that of course, this being just usenet. the people in power shouldn't be so childish. bm] if you belong to the armenian diaspora, keep in mind that what strikes bm] your fancy on the map is costing the local armenians dearly in terms of bm] their blood and future. henrik] again, you are taking different turns. armenia has no intension henrik] to grab any land from azerbaijan. the armenians in karabakh henrik] are simply defending themselves until a solution is set. azeri's would disagree with you on this, and the maps i've seen support what they'd be saying. it doesn't seem likely that a solution will be reached in this manner. bm] it's easy to be comfortable abroad and propagandize bm] craziness to have your feelings about turks tickled. the armenians bm] in armenia and n-k will be there, with the same people you seem to hate bm] as their neighbors, for maybe 3000 years more. the sooner there's peace in bm] the region the better it is for them and everyone else. i'd push for bm] compromise if i were you instead of hitting the caps-lock and spreading bm] inflammatory half-truths. henrik] it is not up to me to decide the peace initiative. i am absolutely henrik] for it. it didn't look it when i read your posting. it would seem to me that if you can spew mis-information about a boogey-man, you can also talk about how one might avoid the nastiness. fair? henrik] but, in the meantime, if you do not take care of yourself, henrik] you will be wiped out. such as the case in the era of 1915-20 of henrik] the armenian massacres. you don't realize i can say the same thing about 'the turkish massacres.' yes, boys and girls, let's always talk about how bad and nasty things were. let's do that so we're overwhelmed by anger, and let's do that so our kids will also be hateful. sounds crazy doesn't it? don't do it then.",

            "they do. according the the los angeles police department, illegal manufacture is one the three primary sources of machine guns and submachine guns used in crimes (sumggling and theft from the police and military being the other two.) washington d.c. police have stated that 40% (if i'm remembering the figure correctly) of the guns they conficate were illegally built. it takes about 6 hours and a few tools to make one (at least one of reasonable quality). unless the drug dealer enjoyes messing around on a lathe (say, as a hobby), he's going to have to pay someone anyway. materials plus six hours of a machinist's time for something legal would run about $100. the blackmarket prices for guns are usually in the $50 to $200 range (at least those few i've seen cited in newspaper articles were...) washington d.c. has a total ban on handguns and prohibits assembled rifles within city limits. it's homicide rate is almost ten times the national average. it is also illegal for a d.c. resident to drive to the virginia or maryland suburbs and buy a gun (dealers are required by federal law to check ids and make sure the buyer isn't from another state) so the ban can not be easily side-stepped. sure. but it you couldn't buy one, you would write your own (in fact, people _did_ write their own 15 years ago...) more likely, you would find a friend who was a particularly good programer and get him give you a copy of his. software is a _very_ bad example for your case: how many people do you know with illegal copies of $400 word processors? if people want something, and it isn't available (or affordable) legally, they will usually get it illegally. quite. 13-3-2. the formula has been around for half a million years. or are you going to restrict sales of sulpher, charcoal and saltpeter? that's alot cruder than modern smokless powder, but it works very well. the only real problems are a ~25% reduction in energy (so a .357 magnum would \"only\" be as deadly as a 9mm) and it makes alot more smoke... of course, a smart black marketeer could just make the gun in 9mm and steal the ammunition from the police (the police are often corruptable, and things are known to disappear from police evidence rooms and armories and reappear on the streets...) perhaps you weren't watching the news two years ago, but the serbs also tried to invade slovinia. they were driven out after a few weeks by partisans armed with home-made _anti-tank_ weapons. the afghan rebels frequently made their own rifles.",

            "i would like to see a serious discussion on the best way to install windows from a novell administrator's point of view. i just got off the phone with ms access support and was told that they (microsoft) has decided to implement, as a standard for software support, the local setup (described below) as the \"most advantageous installation\". if this is true and microsoft deems this to be the most prudent installation then i will comply but i'd like to hear it from administrators first. the local windows installation: ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ windows is fully installed on each workstation hard drive (assuming the resources are available). from a network administrator's implementation, he/she would install all windows disks on a network drive using setup/a. then install windows on a per/machine bases by running setup off the network to install the complete system on the local drives. in this way, all drivers are available to the setup procedure w/o the need to change disks. advantages: - reduce traffic - running windows locally reduces network traffic due to the local access of main windows files. - network independence - if the network fails (and they all do at one point or another), the local installation would allow users to keep producing and reduce the cost of down-time. - faster windows - theoretically, windows will run faster from a local hard drive than over a network. this may be a hard point to prove if the network has an optical backbone and/or the network drives are significantly faster access than local ones. - a user traveling from machine to machine does not need to worry about varying setups (monochrome, color, types of mouse, etc...) since the windows installation is assigned to the workstation. disadvantages: - cost - installing windows locally requires a significant amount of disk space. workstations now must be purchased with a hard disk that can increase the cost of the workstation from 10 to 30 percent. - administration - local windows installations are very difficult to administer. new drivers for peripherals are constantly being made available, each of which would have to be individually installed on each workstation. - security - users now have access to erase or corrupt their own system files from simple ignorance. this could result in quite a headache for administrators who may have to constantly repair damaged installations. - backup - we all know the problems backing up local hard disks. the backup sets (if done via a centralized tape system) get very large very quickly. backup individually (to floppy) may not happen at all. this may be eliminated if it is assumed that local hard disks only contain replaceable applications and *not* user data. the shared windows installation ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ windows is fully installed to a network disk via the setup/a procedure described above. users (or administrators) then install a minimal set of files to individual \"user\" directories. these directories may be on a local hard disk or perhaps a network \"home\" directory. the bulk of the windows system files are maintained on the network in a single directory (some 400+ files) and are accessed (shared) as-needed by users throughout their windows session. the user's files consist of a small set of files that the user has updated during his/her windows session. these include group files, .ini files and other regularly updated files. advantages: - a single location for all files makes updates to drives easy. as an updated driver becomes available, it only needs to be installed in this single directory for all users to be able to take advantage of it. - assuming that the users' files are maintained in network (home) directories, the administrator can easily edit any .ini file as-needed to correct problems that may arise. this includes win.ini and system.ini. - backup of all pertinent files is done easily. even if the users' files are on a local hard disk, the bulk of the windows system is backed up with all driver updates. disadvantages: - network traffic - since all windows files are being shared in a network directory, traffic on the network can become a problem an effect the speed of windows. - if the network crashes, all production comes to a stop since window's is reliant upon the network for its files. loss of data usually occurs as well since users working in windows at the time of the crash will usually not be able to save their work. - although minimal, disk space is still a consideration. if the users' files are maintained on the network, a large number of users can cause a significant utilization of disk space due to their personal windows files alone. - users cannot easily move from machine to machine unless the workstation hardware are similar. this is due to the windows installation being tied to a particular username (in the case of network user files). the discussion ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ i would like to know, from other administrators with a large windows userbase, how they prefer setting up windows. personally, i have setup numerous installations using the shared setup. all windows and application files are on the network with little or no utilization of local hard disks. in fact, i sold a network on the fact that the company would no longer need to purchase hard disks for their workstations and thus save that much more money. i would also like to see recommendations for applications. should apps such as word and/or excel be installed locally regardless of how windows is installed? again, i keep all files on the network for easy backup and administration but this is \"putting all eggs in one basket\"; if the network crashes, work comes to a halt.",

            "tim belcher pitched a dandy three-hit shut-out tonight as cincinnati won their second straight 5-0. pittsburgh lefty randy tomlin was hit early and often by the heavily right-unbalanced reds line-up, which managed some recently rare power with their bats. belcher (1-1) was solid throughout and in fact seemed to get stronger as the game progressed. early on he had several three-ball counts, but even those were few and far between later on as he allowed only one base-on-balls while striking out nine. in a post game interview he said his change-up was working for him--i should say so: all nine of his strikeouts were apparently on breaking balls. tomlin (0-1), on the other hand was in trouble early, giving up a second-pitch double to lead-off batter bip roberts. bobby kelly followed with a single and barry larkin scored roberts with a sharp single to right. the big guys (mitchell, sabo, milligan) were unable to get anything after that--in fact they all struck out--but kelly managed a score anyway due to a double-steal and a tomlin wild pitch. in fact, it appeared that tomlin was going to recover nicely from his shaky start-- he retired 9 of the next 11 batters to get to the fourth behind only 2-0. randy milligan, though, had different ideas as his line-shot was poorly played by orlando merced and turned into a triple. milligan would later score on reggie sanders' sacrifice fly, giving cinci the 3-0 lead after 4. the fifth inning spelled loss for tomlin when roberts led off with his second double of the game, and one batter later larkin smacked a double down the left field line, chasing tomlin. barry later would score the final run on tom prince's two-base passed ball. the pirates managed their only threat of the day in the bottom half of the fifth when merced and kevin young hit back-to-back singles (the second being of the \"bunt\" variety), but carlos garcia struck out, prince fit a foul fly, and pinch-hitter lonnie smith \"k'd\" to end any pittsburgh hope. pittsburgh pitchers backed tomlin up well, though: relievers blas minor, moeller (sp?), and nagel gave up only two hits in their four-plus innings work. barry larkin left the game in the seventh when the grounder he (mis)played bruised his right thumb. he was taken to the hospital for \"precautionary x-rays\". let's hope he's ok. cincinnati is now 4-9, still the worst record in the majors, but with the two wins they may be looking at moving out of the cellar! pittsburgh is now 7-6. *********reds fans*************************** if you would like to receive this report on a semi-daily basis (as often as i write it), send me your e-mail address and i'll put you on the list. if someone has a reds mailing list, please forward it to me and i'll put everyone on the list!! ********************************************* cincinnati reds ab r h k bb lo -----------------------------------------------|--------------------------- roberts 2b 4 2 2 1 0 1 kelly cf 4 1 1 0 0 0 larkin ss 3 1 3 0 0 0 branson ss 0 0 0 0 0 0 mitchell lf 4 0 1 1 0 0 hernandez lf 0 0 0 0 0 0 sabo 3b 4 0 0 1 0 1 milligan 1b 4 1 1 2 0 1 sanders rf 3 0 0 2 0 0 oliver c 4 0 2 2 0 0 belcher p 4 0 0 2 0 1 --------------------------------------------------------------------------- totals 34 5 10 11 0 4 3b milligan (off tomlin, leading off fourth, scored) 2b roberts (off tomlin, leading off first, scored) roberts (off tomlin, leading off fifth, scored) larkin (off tomlin, in fifth, one out, runner on second, rbi, scored) sf sanders rbi larkin 2, sanders sb kelly, larkin gdp sabo pittsburgh pirates ab r h k bb lo -----------------------------------------------|--------------------------- martin lf 4 0 0 0 0 1 bell ss 4 0 0 1 0 0 van slyke cf 4 0 0 0 0 0 king 3b 3 0 0 2 1 0 merced rf 3 0 1 1 0 0 young 1b 2 0 1 1 0 0 garcia 2b 3 0 0 2 0 1 prince c 3 0 1 0 0 0 tomlin p 1 0 0 0 0 0 minor p 0 0 0 0 0 0 smith ph 1 0 0 1 0 2 moeller p 0 0 0 0 0 0 waynor ph 1 0 0 1 0 0 nagel p 0 0 0 0 0 0 --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 29 0 3 9 1 4 gdp merced --------------------------------------------------------------------------- cincinnati 2 0 0 1 2 0 0 0 0 ----- 5 11 1 pittsburgh 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ----- 0 3 0 pitching ip r er h k bb cincinnati belcher (w 1-1) 9 0 0 3 9 1 cg (1), so (1) $$$line of the day!!!$$$ e- larkin pittsburgh tomlin (l 0-1) 4 1/3 5 5 9 6 0 minor 2/3 0 0 1 0 0 moeller 2 0 0 0 3 0 nagel 1 0 0 1 2 0 wp- tomlin pb- prince umps rippley/hallion/quick/crawford att-9,077 t-2:14 coming up: the reds play two more in pitts, then go to chicago for a weekend series. the weather doesn't look good, though-- don't be surprised if one or more games get rained out. tomorrow, 7:35, jose rijo vs. steve cook, then smiley vs. wakefield on thursday.",

            "as promised, i spoke today with the company mentioned in a washington times article about the clipper chip announcement. the name of the company is secure communicatiions technology (information will be given at the end of this message on how to contact them). basically they are disturbed about the announcement for many reasons that we are. more specifically however, mr. bryen of secure communications brought to light many points that might interest most of the readers. his belief is that at&t was made known of the clipper well before the rest of the industry. this is for several reasons, several of which are: - a company of at&t's size could never be able to make a decision to use the new chip on the same day it was announced. - months ago they proposed using their own chip for at&t's secure telephone devices. at&t basically blew them off as being not interested at all. this stuck them as strange, until now... also i spoke with art melnick, their cryptographer, he expressed several concerns over the new clipper chip: - the obvious backdoor will be able to let many people decrypt the code. - once the key is released to authorities the security of the crypto system is lost forever. these keys can end up in the hands of any agency of the government. - the fact that the escrowed keys never change means that the algorithm is vulnerable over time to an attacker. - the classified algorithm may hide another backdoor. but he feels that it is probably to keep people from forging fake serial numbers, or changing the keys themselves. - additionally he feels that the nsa has probably spent enough time and money in working on a way to keep this chip from being reversed engineered, that he feels that reverse engineering it will be very difficult to do. he feels that they have developed a suitable technique to protect the chip from this attack. also he feels that the chip is hardware encoded with the algorithm and not microcoded onto the chip. additonally i spoke with mr. melnick about their algorithm. he couldn't tell me much about their new agorithm because it hasn't been patented yet. however he told me a little: - the algorithm will be released for public review after patents have been granted for it. this is so the crypto community can see that it is secure. - the algorithm is called nea for new encryption algorithm. the details were sketchy because now it is held as a trade secret until the patent was issued, but i was told that it will incorporate the following: - it will have fast encryption of data (exact specs not given, but mr. melnick stated \"much faster than what an rs-232 can put out.\") - it is a symmetric cipher, just like idea and des. - it will use 64 bit data blocks for encryption (like des and idea). - the key length was not given to me, but mr. melnick states that it is _adujustable_ and is \"more than adequate for security.\" - the algorithm is written in c and assembler in software form, and can be ported to many platforms (unlike the the clipper chip which is hardware only and cannot be made into software) this i consider a definite plus for the nea for widespread use. - the algorithm will accomodate public key distribution techniques such as rsa or diffie-hellman. this will also be supported in the hardware chip. - right now the projected cost of the nea chip will be about 10 dollars for each!!

            "if i may offer a constructive criticism, perhaps you should decide if you love vehicles or the use they are put to. i, myself, think the f-86 is a beautiful aircraft, but rest assured, i wouldn't even think of flying it in combat today. most of us want access to space and judge vehicles on how they perform. not to this degree. why? your wrong. the dc approach is very tollerent of failure. it also has the advantage of far greater reliability do to its reusable nature (shuttle isn't reusable, it's salvagable). the flip over happens at a very low speed, not supersonic. if the dc-x shows the flip over works, it will work unless the laws of physics change. the final dc-1 will have fully intact abort throughout the entire flight envelop. upon re-entry for example, it can loose about 80% of available thrust and still land safely. everything can suffer from catastrophic failure but that's not the same thing. shuttle simply isn't a fault tolerent design, ssto is. you don't put your patients in conditions where there is no way out. you wouldn't for example, give a patient a drug and not monitor them for harmful side effects would you? you are very much in the minority. if the dc series fails to make orbit, it will still be a very worthwhile effort. it will show us exactly what we do need to do to build ssto. again, refering to the dc-1, it will provide fully intact abort theroughout the flight envelop. shuttle doesn't. dc is fault tollerent, shuttle isn't. not true. build a passenger pallet (a fairly easy thing to do) and it will carry passengers. i would suggest you talk to the dc-x crew themselves. their original schedule had an operational dc-1 flying in 96. your ignoring the dammage it does. mannes space has a reputation for being unreliable and hugely expensive. shuttle supporters only make it easy for opponents of manned space to kill it. the only way to prove those things is to build it. allen",

            "the following was published in the may 15th rocky mountain news. i guess i have some real ethical problems with the practices at this church. i understand that baptism is an overriding factor. i also understand that this is not an honest way to proceed. unfortunately, this is becoming more typical of congregations as the second coming is perceived to approach. there is a real element of disparation in this 'make it happen at any cost' style of theology. i wonder where trust in the lord fits into this equation? baptisms draw parents' ire -- children at church carnival in springs told they'd be killed by bee stings if they didn't submit to religious rite. by dick foster -- rocky mountain news southern bureau colorado springs -- outraged parents say their children were lured to a church carnival and then baptixed without their permission by a baptist minister. doxens of children, some as young as 8 years old and unaccompanied by their parents, thought they were going to a carnival at the cornerstone baptist church, where there would be a big water fight, free balloons, squirt guns and candy. before that may 1 carnival was over, however, children were whisked into a room for religious instruction and told they should be baptized. in many cases they consented, although they or their families are not of the baptist faith. the baptisms by the church have angered many parents, including paulette lamontagne, a methodist and mother of twin 8-year-old girls who were baptized without her knowledge or consent. 'my understnading was they were going to a carnival. i feel that's a false pretense,' said lamontagne. her daughters said the minister told them they would be killed by bee stings if they were not baptized. cornerstone church officials defended their actions. 'we take our instructions from the word of god and god has commanded us to baptize converts. no one can show me one passage in the bible where it says that parental permission is required before a child is baptized,' said dan irwin, associate pastor of the cornerstone baptist church. church officials did not tell parents their children would be baptized because 'they didn't ask,' irwin said. many other parents also felt they were simply sending their children to a carnival at the invitation of their children's friends who were members of the cornerstone church. police said chhurch officials had broken on laws in baptizing the children, but indicated the parents could pursue civil action. ------------------------------------------- aren't these the same behaviors we condemn in the hari krishnas and other cults? [i think the issues are more complex than the newspaper account mentions. first, i'm not entirely sure that parental consent is absolutely required. this would be extremely difficult, because of the clear commandment to obey parents. but if an older child insisted on being baptized without their parents' consent, i might be willing to do it. however this would be a serious step, and would warrant much careful discussion. the problem i find here is not so much parental consent as that there was nobody's consent. whether you believe in infant baptism or not, baptism is supposed to be the sign of entry into a christian community. if there isn't a commitment from *somebody*, whether parent or child, and no intent to become part of the church, the baptism appears to be a lie. furthermore, it is likely to raise serious practical problems. what if the child is from a baptist tradition? normally when he reaches the age of decision, he would be expected to make a decision and be baptized. but he already has been, by a church claiming to be a baptist church. so does he get rebaptized? neither answer is really very good. if not, he's being robbed of an experience that should be very significant to his faith.",

(mat 23:23-25) this, and the discussion later in mat 5, suggest that jesus has a very specific view of the law in mind, and that when he talks about maintaining the law in its full strength, he is thinking of these aspects of it. paul's conclusion is similar. while he talks about the law being superceded, all of the specific examples he gives involve the \"ceremonial law\", such as circumcision and the sabbath. he is quite concerned about maintaining moral standards. the net result of this is that when paul talks about the law being superceded, and jesus talks about the law being maintained, i believe they are talking about different aspects of the law. paul is embroiled in arguments about circumcision. as is natural in letters responding to specific situations, he's looking at the aspect of the law that is currently causing trouble: the law as specifically jewish ceremonies. he certainly does not intend to abolish divine standards of conduct. on the other hand, when jesus commends the law, he seems to be talking the law in its broadest implications for morals and human relationships, and deemphasizing those aspects that were later to give paul so much trouble. it's unfortunate that people use the same terms in different ways, but we should be familiar with that from current conflicts. look at the way terms like \"family values\" take on special meaning from the current context. imagine some poor historian of the future trying to figure out why \"family values\" should be used as a code word for opposition to homosexuality in one specific period in the u.s. i think law had taken on a similar role in the arguments paul was involved in. paul was clearly not rejecting all of the jewish values that go along with the term \"law\", any more than people who concerned about the \"family values\" movement are really opposed to family values.",

            "re; response from cob of boeing on ssto ... boeing has been looking at several tsto vehicles and has carried out extensive conceptual studies of advanced launch systems for some time. a good reference on this might be: \"comparison of propulsion options for advanced earth-to-orbit (eto) applications (iaf-92- 0639).\" by v.a. weldon and l.e. fink from boeing. the paper describes a propane-fueled tsto launch system claimed to achieve aircraft-like operational efficiencies without the problems associated with liquid hydrogen fuel. basically, it's a high-speed airplane launching a hermes-type spaceplane the design (the concept is also called \"beta\") as laid out in the paper can launch at least 10,000 pounds into polar orbit, or 20,000 pounds to space station orbit including a crew of eight persons and life support. system design reliability is .9995. beta is a 360-foot-long first stage powered by two large ramjets and 12 high- speed civil transport (hsct) turbofans. a 108-foot- long reusable orbiter is trapeze-mounted in the belly of the first- stage aircraft, which also could accommodate a longer and heavy payload on an expendable second stage. to launch the orbital vehicle, the first stage takes off like a normal hsct and accelerates to mach 3. at that point the turbofans, modified to burn catalyzed jp-7, would shut off and the ramjets, would take over. at mach 5.5 the orbiter or the elv would swing out, ignite and proceed to orbit. both vehicles would land like aircraft at the conclusion of their respective missions. estimated total weight of the combined configuration at takeoff is about 1.5 m lbs, roughly equivalanet to a fully loaded an-225. the orbiter stages weighs about 400,klbs including 335 klbs of lox and subcooled propane to power two 250 klbs vacuum thrust rocket engines. propellants would be stored at 91 degrees kelvin, with the propane in a spherical tank mounted forward of the 15-by- 25-foot cargo bay and the two-seat orbiter crew station. lox would be stored aft. weldon and fink claim the key to this design's success is the structurally efficient airframe and the compact tankage allowed by the high-density supercooled hydrocarbon fuel. the paper compares tsto design to ssto design. they conclude while a ssto has a slightly lower recurring cost, a tsto is easier, cheaper, and less risky to develop, simpler to build, has greater safety and mission versatility and doesn't carry the hard-to-handle and bulky hydrogen fuel. the conlcude \"in conjunction with its major use of airplane type engines and fuel, as well as its inherent self- ferry capability, it is probably the system most likely to provide as close to airline-like operations as possible with a practical configuration, until a single stage airbreather/rocket concept can be shown to be operationally viable.\" weldon and others at boeing have been working on tsto designs for some time. i expect this, or a similar concept (perhaps the hthl ssto they proposed for the sdio ssto first phase) is being re- examined as a basis for a bid on the first phase of spacelifter. does it threaten dc-???. possibly -- there is a set of on-going studies trying straighten out the government's future space transportation strategy. mdc and boeing (as well as other firms) are providing data to a joint study team back in dc. there are various factions and options vying for attention -- including shuttle upgrades, shuttle replacement (what was called the \"4-2-3\" architecture), spacelifter, elv upgrades, and various advanced vehicles (ales, beta, dc-??, nasp, fsts, sstos of several types, etc.) nasa/dod/dot are trying to put together a coherent strategy for future us gov't space transportation systems, and trying to juggle near-term launch needs (like for dod and nasa) against medium-term needs (including commercial considerations), and against the investment and risk of going to \"leap frog\" new technologies like sdio/ssto and nasp and beta. it's a heck of a problem. the worst part of the problem isn't that there aren't promising ideas and concepts -- there are dozens of them -- but how they balance cost and risk versus real needs in the near term. they should have a draft report in mid-june, with a final report coming by the end of the fiscal year. ------------------------------------------------------------------ wales larrison space technology investor",

'i don't believe you,\" i said, but followed to a nail-studded door. the man pushed it ajar, then spurred away, leaving me to check on the corpse. i thought i should, this charge was so constant, so gritted my teeth and went inside. the place was cool but reeked of sodden ashes, and was dark at first, for its stone walls had only window slits. rags strewed the mud floor around an iron tripod over embers that vented their smoke through roof beams black with soot. all looked bare and empty, but in an inner room flies buzzed. as the door swung shut behind me i saw they came from a man's body lying face up, naked but for its grimy turban. he was about fifty years old by what was left of his face - a rifle butt had bashed an eye. the one left slanted, as with tartars rather than with turks. any uniform once on him was gone, so i'd no proof which he was, and quickly went out, gagging at the mess of his slashed genitals.\" p. 363 (first paragraph). 'how many people lived there?' 'oh, about eight hundred.' he yawned. 'did you see any turk officers?' 'no, sir. i was in at dawn. all were tartar civilians in mufti.' \"the lieutenant dozed off, then i, but in the small hours a voice woke me - dro's. he stood in the starlight bawling out an officer. anyone keelhauled so long and furiously i'd never heard. then abruptly dro broke into laughter, quick and simple as child's. both were a cover for his sense of guilt, i thought, or hoped. for somehow, despite my boast of irreligion, christian massacring 'infidels' was more horrible than the reverse would have been. from daybreak on, armenian villagers poured in from miles around..... the women plundered happily, chattering like ravens as they picked over the carcass of djul. they hauled out every hovel's chattels, the last scrap of food or cloth, and staggered away, packing pots, saddlebags, looms, even spinning-wheels. 'thank you for a lot, dro,' i said to him back in camp. 'but now i must leave.'...we shook hands, the captain said 'a bientot, mon camarade.' and for hours the old molokan scout and i plodded north across parching plains. like lot's wife i looked back once to see smoke bathing all, doubtless in a sack of other moslem villages up to the line of snow that was iran.'\" p. 354. \"at morning tea, dro and his officers spread out a map of this whole high region called the karabakh. deep in tactics, they spoke russian, but i got their contempt for allied 'neutral' zones and their distrust of promises made by tribal chiefs. a campaign shaped; more raids on moslem villages.\" p. 358. \"it will be three hours to take,\" dro told me. we'd close in on three sides. \"the men on foot will not shoot, but use only the bayonets,\" merrimanov said, jabbing a rifle in dumbshow. \"that is for morale,\" dro put in. \"we must keep the moslems in terror.\" \"soldiers or civilians?\" i asked. \"there is no difference,\" said dro. \"all are armed, in uniform or not.\" \"but the women and children?\" \"will fly with the others as best they may.\" p. 360. \"the ridges circled a wide expanse, its floors still. hundreds of feet down, the fog held, solid as cotton flock. 'djul lies under that,' said dro, pointing. 'our men also attack from the other sides.' then, 'whee-ee!' - his whistle lined up all at the rock edge. bayonets clicked upon carbines. over plunged archo, his black haunches rippling; then followed the staff, the horde - nose to tail, bellies taking the spur. armenia in action seemed more like a pageant than war, even though i heard our utica brass roar. as i watched from the height, it took ages for djul to show clear. a tsing of machine-gun fire took over from the thumping batteries; cattle lowed, dogs barked, invisible, while i ate a hunk of cheese and drank from a snow puddle. mist at last folded upward as men shouted, at first heard faintly. the came a shrill wailing. now among the cloud-streaks rose darker wisps - smoke. red glimmered about house walls of stone or wattle, into dry weeds on roofs. a mosque stood in clump of trees, thick and green. through crooked alleys on fire, horsemen were galloping after figures both mounted and on foot. 'tartarski!' shouted the gunner by me. others pantomimed them in escape over the rocks, while one twisted a bronze shell-nose, loaded, and yanked breech-cord, firing again and again. shots wasted, i thought, when by afternoon i looked in vain for fallen branch or body. but these shots and the white bursts of shrapnel in the gullies drowned the women's cries. at length all shooting petered out. i got on my horse and rode down toward djul. it burned still but little flame showed now. the way was steep and tough, through dense scrub. finally on flatter ground i came out suddenly, through alders, on smoldering houses. across trampled wheat my brothers-in- arms were leading off animals, several calves and a lamb.\" p. 361 (fourth paragraph). \"corpses came next, the first a pretty child with straight black hair, large eyes. she looked about twelve years old. she lay in some stubble where meal lay scattered from the sack she'd been toting. the bayonet had gone through her back, i judged, for blood around was scant. between the breasts one clot, too small for a bullet wound, crusted her homespun dress. the next was a boy of ten or less, in rawhide jacket and knee-pants. he lay face down in the path by several huts. one arm reached out to the pewter bowl he'd carried, now upset upon its dough. steel had jabbed just below his neck, into the spine. there were grownups, too, i saw as i led the sorrel around. djul was empty of the living till i looked up to see beside me dro's german-speaking colonel. he said all tartars who had not escaped were dead.\" p. 358. \"...more stories of armenian murdering turks when the czarist troops fled north. my hosts told me of their duty here: to keep tabs on brigands, turkish troop shifts, hidden arms, spies - christian, red or tartar - coming in from transcaucasus. then they spoke of the hell that would break loose if versailles were to put, as threatened, the six 'armenian' vilayets of turkey under the control of erevan... an armenia without armenians! turks under christian rule? his lips smacked in irony under the droopy red moustache. that's bloodshed - just smyrna over again on a bigger scale.\" serdar argic",

            "the problem with your nihilistic approach, roger, is that it takes all the sense out of the game. by your line of reasoning, if a guy hits into a double play with one out and the bases loaded, there's no point in saying that that was a bad thing to do (if his team won anyway) or speculating on what might have happened if things had gone otherwise, so the double play is merely an event that happened in the course of a game that was eventually won or lost for unknown reasons. after all, any speculation involves constructing a fantasy about what would have happened but didn't. roger, do you ever worry that the next pencil you drop will fall to the ceiling instead? or are you willing to consider empirical evidence? teams go to the post-season when they win more games than anybody else in their division. if they don't make the post-season, they don't win the series. will you agree that winning a division is a useful intermediate goal in ring-collecting? if so, you must agree that winning games is a useful intermediate goal towards winning the division, and our disagreements come when we consider how to win games. in your viewpoint as expressed, winning games happens for reasons that cannot be analyzed. while many of us are thinking things like \"base- runners are good, outs are bad, and therefore walks are better than double plays with the bases loaded\", you are thinking things like \"it's a team game, so perhaps the double play will cause some mysterious team dynamics that will cause the team to win today\". the result is that it becomes impossible to say *anything* about individual players. perhaps atlanta would have won the series with me playing left field. after all, perhaps in some way my knowledge and personality would have helped the team more than my complete lack of skill would have hurt it. therefore, i could be an extremely valuable player. did dave winfield have anything to do with the jays' victory? probably, but how do you know? if you replace him with andres galarraga, perhaps the jays would have won, perhaps they would have lost, perhaps they would have defected to alpha centauri (bearing in mind that the flying saucers would not have landed in mid-season had winfield been dhing for toronto). was babe ruth a good player? he played on some ws-winning teams, but did he have anything to do with their success? it is generally accepted that ernie banks was a good baseball player, and jarvis brown and dan schatzeder weren't. it seems to me that anybody who would deny this needs to provide the proof. now, we have observed things about baseball over the years, both empirically and by looking at the rulebook. it is necessary to score more runs than one's opponent to win the game, so it would seem important to score runs and to prevent one's opponent from scoring. runs are scored while a team is batting, and an inning ends after the third out, so it would seem that making outs is bad while hitting home runs is good. players have tendencies to hit or pitch at certain levels, and these are usually somewhat consistent from year to year. we do use these statistics to predict winners, and so do you. to make some flat predictions: barry bonds will have a higher obp+slg than gene larkin this year. the braves will finish ahead of the rockies in the standings. the tigers will score more runs than the royals, but will also give up more. i would be astonished if any of these turned out to be false, and, i suspect, so would you. as a matter of fact, i am pretty sure i can predict all the division winners this year, given 3-4 guesses per division, and this is certainly better than random chance (and almost statistically significant). if you will admit that the rockies and mariners are unlikely to meet in the world series, you must admit that there is some sort of way to measure likelihoods, however fuzzy. so how about \"real life\"? person a robs a service station with two people in it, using a .38 automatic pistol, gets $42, and is convicted and sentenced for three years. person b, with a similar criminal record, robs a service station with two people in it, using a .38 revolver, gets $42, and is convicted. since they used two different types of handgun, are comparisons totally meaningless? say you drop a pencil to see if the gravity still works (my cats are always testing this - they don't trust me to pay the gravity bill on time). you have never dropped a pencil at that exact time of the century before, so all previous evidence is meaningless? or would you be surprised if it flew out the window instead of hitting the desk?",

            "this response originally fell into a bit bucket. i'm reposting it just so bill doesn't think i'm ignoring him. bill, i'm sorry to have been busy lately and only just be getting around to this. apparently you have some fundamental confusions about atheism; i think many of these are well addressed in the famous faq. your generalisms are then misplaced -- atheism needn't imply materialism, or the lack of an absolute moral system. however, i do tend to materialism and don't believe in absolute morality, so i'll answer your questions. an atheist judges value in the same way that a theist does: according to a personal understanding of morality. that i don't believe in an absolute one doesn't mean that i don't have one. i'm just explicit, as in the line of postings you followed up, that when i express judgment on a moral issue i am basing my judgment on my own code rather than claiming that it is in some absolute sense good or bad. my moral code is not particular different from that of others around me, be they christians, muslims, or atheists. so when i say that i object to genocide, i'm not expressing anything particularly out of line with what my society holds. if your were to ask why i think morality exists and has the form it does, my answer would be mechanistic to your taste -- that a moral code is a prerequisite for a functioning society, and that humanity probably evolved morality as we know it as part of the evolution of our ability to exist in large societies, thereby achieving considerable survival advantages. you'd probably say that god just made the rules. neither of us can convince the other, but we share a common understanding about many moral issues. you think you get it from your religion, i think i get it (and you get it) from early childhood teaching. i think you've been reading the wrong sort of comic books, but in prying through the gobbledygook i basically agree with what you're saying. i do believe that my mental reactions to stimuli such as \"god commanded the genocide of the canaanites\" is mechanistic, but of course i think that's true of you as well. my reaction has little to do with whether god exists or even with whether i think he does, but if a god existed who commanded genocide, i could not consider him good, which is supposedly an attribute of god. hmm. yes, i think some heavy faq-reading would do you some good. i have as much place discussing values etc. as any other person. in fact, i can actually accomplish something in such a discussion, by framing the questions in terms of reason: for instance, it is clear that in an environment where neighboring tribes periodically attempt to wipe each other out based on imagined divine commands, then the quality of life will be generally poor, so a system that fosters coexistence is superior, if quality of life is an agreed goal. an absolutist, on the other hand, can only thump those portions of a bible they happen to agree with, and say \"this is good\", even if the act in question is unequivocally bad by the standards of everyone in the discussion. the attempt to define someone or a group of people as \"excluded from discussion\", such that they \"cannot participate\", and their opinions given \"no weight whatsoever\" is the lowest form or reasoning (ad hominem/poisoning the well), and presumably the resort of someone who can't rationally defend their own ideas of right, wrong, and the bible. -- jim perry perry@dsinc.com decision support, inc., matthews nc these are my opinions. for a nominal fee, they can be yours.",

            "gifts of the spirit should not be seen as an endorsement of ones behavior. a lot of people have suffered because of similar beliefs. jesus said that people would come to him saying \"lord, lord,\" and proclaiming the miraculous works they had done in his name. jesus would tell them that they were workers of iniquity that do not know him, and to depart from him. that is not to say that this will happen to everyone who commits a homosexual sin. if the holy spirit were only given to the morally perfect, he would not be given to me, or any of us. god can forgive any sin, if we repent. but people should be careful not to think, \"god has given me a gift of the spirit, it must be okay to be gay.\" that is dangerous (see also hebrews 6 about those who have partaken of the holy spirit and of the powers of the world to come.) jesus doesn't ask us to change our own nature. we cannot lift ourselves out of our own sin- but we must submit to his hand as he changes our nature. practicing homosexual acts and homosexual lusts violates the morality that god has set forth. if you don't believe that, and think those of us who do are just ignorant, then at least consider us weak in the faith and be celebate for our sake's. is practicing homosexuality worth the cost of a soul, whether it be the homosexual's or the one considered \"ignorant?\"",

then you have been enslaved, percentage wise, most of your life. we used to be serfs. now we are called renters, and we are still enslaved to somebody who claims to own land they don't use and make us pay them for it when they did nothing to own it. most rents in california are enough to buy the apartment house, paynthe taxes and the insurance and have a little left over to travel with! i have seen the books! i know what my landlord pays and to whom! i know what i pay her. i am being forced to buy her a building and then i will be let out at the other end with nothing, when i had as much right as her to live on this planet! and her child will have the money to likewise enslave my child. i hope i find out when i am going to die. i can make things just a little happier form me to be able to destroy her life as she destroyed mine. and maybe i can take a few other landlords with me, and their heirs. that would be worth it. then to be able to die before they can do anything to me. that's a poor man's dream. sleep tight, bastard landlords. you don't know the trouble you are buying yourself as you sleep on my heirs money in your mattress! -rsw",

[emphasis added by me] investigators will re-create conditions at the compound and identify accelerants and other fac- tors fueling the inferno. that is their strong suit. but the public must question why agents of the federal bureau of investigation lacked the oper- ational skill and teh behavioral insight to resolve the 51-day standoff free of flames and fury. the loss of life most clearly reflects the demen- tia of cult leader david koresh, whose personal delusiosn are now seared on the public conscious- ness. his assembly of davidians had stockpiles of arms--and had used them. little in the way of rationality could be expected from koresh, a self- confsesed \"sinner without equal.\" what continues to mystify are th eactions of federal agents, who bungled the case from the start. the misadventure began on feb. 28 when 100 agents of the federal bureau of alcohol, to- bacco and firearms storemd the compound, intent on seizing koresh and a cache of automatic weap- ons. four agents and an estimated six cult mem- bers died inteh ensuing gun battle. earlier oppor-tunities to isolate and arrest koresh outside the complex had not been adequately explored. authorities prepared a siege and resolved that those deaths would be the last. fifty-one days into the siege there was no public outcry to storm the compound. it had been correctly perceived that the chil- dren inside \"rancho apocalypse\" were essentially hostages. with their lives at stake, there was no reason for the government to be impatient. the government's superior firepower, control of water and utilities and freedom of movement created the conditions for a belated but bloodless resolution. neither attorney general janet reno nor the fbi has provided a sigle compelling reason for abandondoning the course of patience. if intelligence was accurate and koresh was growing increasingly violent and bizarre, it is diffi- cult to see how a tear-gas attack launched by an m-60 combat vehicle would clear his mind. if re- ports of escalating child abuse were accurate, they would have to be weighted against the potential for eve ngreated hamr. etc etc tec.... [paragraphs, 2.5 paragraphs deleted] but some of the responsibility rests with clinton, and inexperienced president who did not pay enough attention to the life-and -death decisions being made on waco. if reno is to be faulted for anything, ti would be for her overreliance on the judgment of law en- forcement officers--a common problem among prosecutors. full investigations into th ewaco tragedy must be conducted by both the executive and legislative branches. the first step is to verify how the blaze started. though apportioning blame will play a role, it is of greater importnace to find strategies to elude the fire next time.",

<8.8> what is going on with anon.penet.fi maintained by j. helsingius? * * * identity ======== _____ <1.1> what is `identity' on the internet? generally, today people's `identity' on the internet is primarily determined by their email address in the sense that this is their most unchanging 'face' in the electronic realm. this is your login name qualified by the complete address domain information, for example ``ld231782@longs.lance.colostate.edu''. people see this address when receiving mail or reading usenet posts from you and in other situations where programs record usage. some obsolete forms of addresses (such as bitnet) still persist. in email messages, additional information on the path that a message takes is prepended to the message received by the recipient. this information identifies the chain of hosts involved in the transmission and is a very accurate trace of its origination. this type of identify-and-forward protocol is also used in the usenet protocol to a lesser extent. forging these fields requires corrupted mailing software at sites involved in the forwarding and is very uncommon. not so uncommon is forging the chain at the origination point, so that all initial sites in the list are faked at the time the message is created. tracing these messages can be difficult or impossible when the initial faked fields are names of real machines and represent real transfer routes. _____ <1.2> why is identity (un)important on the internet? the concept of identity is closely intertwined with communication, privacy, and security, which in turn are all critical aspects of computer networks. for example, the convenience of communication afforded by email would be impossible without conventions for identification. but there are many potential abuses of identity possible that can have very severe consequences, with massive computer networks at the forefront of the issue, which can potentially either exacerbate or solve these problems. verifying that an identity is correct is called `authentication', and one classic example of the problems associated with it is h.g.well's ``war of the worlds'' radio broadcast that fooled segments of the population into thinking that an alien invasion was in progress. hoaxes of this order are not uncommon on usenet and forged identities makes them more insidious. people and their reputations can be assaulted by forgery. however, the fluidity of identity on the internet is for some one of its most attractive features. identity is just as useful as it is harmful. a professor might carefully explain a topic until he finds he is talking to an undergraduate. a person of a particular occupation may be able to converse with others who might normally shun him. some prejudices are erased, but, on the other hand, many prejudices are useful! a scientist might argue he can better evaluate the findings of a paper as a reviewer if he knows more about the authors. likewise, he may be more likely to reject it based on unfair or irrelevant criteria. on the other side of the connection, the author may find identities of reviewers useful in exerting pressure for acceptance. identity is especially crucial in establishing and regulating `credit' (not necessarily financial) and `ownership' and `usage'. many functions in society demand reliable and accurate techniques for identification. heavy reliance will be placed on digital authentication as global economies become increasingly electronic. many government functions and services are based on identification, and law enforcement frequently hinges on it. hence, employees of many government organizations push toward stronger identification structures. but when does identification invade privacy? the growth of the internet is provoking social forces of massive proportions. decisions made now on issues of identity will affect many future users, especially as the network becomes increasingly global, universal, widespread, and entrenched; and the positive or adverse affects of these actions, intended and inadvertent, will literally be magnified exponentially. _____ <1.3> how does my email address (not) identify me and my background? your email address may contain information that influences people's perceptions of your background. the address may `identify' you as from a department at a particular university, an employee at a company, or a government worker. it may contain your last name, initials, or cryptic identification codes independent of both. in the us some are based on parts of social security numbers. others are in the form 'u2338' where the number is incremented in the order that new users are added to the system. standard internet addresses also can contain information on your broad geographical location or nationhood. however, none of this information is guaranteed to be correct or be there at all. the fields in the domain qualification of the username are based on rather arbitrary organization, such as (mostly invisible) network cabling distributions. the only point to make is that early fields in the address are more specific (such as specific computer names or local networks) and the later ones the most general (such as continental domains). typically the first field is the name of the computer receiving mail. gleaning information from the email address alone is sometimes an inspired art or an inconsistent and futile exercise. (for more information, see the faqs on email addresses and known geographical distributions below.) however, unix utilities exist to aid in the quest (see the question on this). common suffixes --------------- .us united states .uk united kingdom .ca canada .fi finland .au australia .edu university or college .com commercial organization .org 'other' (e.g. nonprofit organization) .gov government .mil military site _____ <1.4> how can i find out more about somebody with a given email address? one simple way is to send email to that address, asking. another way is to send mail to the postmaster at that address (i.e. postmaster@address), although the postmaster's job is more to help find user id's of particular people given their real name and solve mail routing problems. the sysadmin (i.e. `root@address') may also be able to supply information. users with related email address may have information. however, all of these methods rely on the time and patience of others so use them minimally. one of the most basic tools for determining identity over the internet is the unix utility 'finger'. the basic syntax is: finger user@here.there.everywhere this utility uses communication protocols to query the computer named in the address for information on the user named. the response is generated completely by the receiving computer and may be in any format. possible responses are as follows: - a message `unknown host' meaning some aspect of the address is incorrect, two lines with no information and '???'. - a message 'in real life: ???' in which case the receiving computer could not find any kind of a match on the username. the finger utility may return this response in other situations. - a listing of information associated with multiple users. some computers will search only for matching user ids, others will attempt to find the username you specified as a substring of all actual full names of users kept in a local database. at some sites 'finger' can be used to get a list of all users on the system with a `finger @address'. in general this is often considered weak security, however, because `attackers' know valid user id's to `crack' passwords. more information on the fields returned by `finger' is given below. more information on `finger' and locating people's email addresses is given in the email faq (such as the whois lookup utility). just as you can use these means to find out about others, they can use them to find out about you. you can `finger' yourself to find out what is publicly reported by your unix system about you. be careful when modifying `finger' data; virtually anyone with internet access worldwide can query this information. in one amazing case, the new york times writer j. markoff uncovered the identity of r. morris, author of the internet worm, through the use of an anonymous tip and 'finger'. see the book cyberspace by k. hafner and j. markoff. _____ <1.5> why is identification (un)stable on the internet? generally, identity is an amorphous and almost nonexistent concept on the internet for a variety of reasons. one is the inherent fluidity of `cyberspace' where people emerge and submerge frequently, and absences are not readily noted in the `community'. most people remember faces and voices, the primary means of casual identification in the 'real world'. the arbitary and cryptic sequences of letters and digits comprising most email addresses are not particularly noticeable or memorable and far from a unique identification of an individual, who may use multiple accounts on multiple machines anywhere in the world. currently internet users do not really have any great assurances that the messages in email and usenet are from who they appear to be. a person's mailing address is far from an identification of an individual. - anyone with access to the account, e.g. they know the password, either legitimately or otherwise, can send mail with that address in the from: line. - email addresses for an individual tend to change frequently as they switch jobs or make moves inside their organizations. - as part of current mailing protocol standards, forging the from: line in mail messages is a fairly trivial operation for many hackers. the status and path information prepended to messages by intermediate hosts is generally unforgeable. in general, while possible, forgeries are fairly rare on most newsgroups and in email. besides these pathological cases abve there are many basic problems with today's internet protocols affecting identification on the internet: - internet mail standards, described in rfc-822, are still evolving rapidly and not entirely orderly. for example, standards for mail address `munging' or `parsing' tend to vary slightly between sites and frequently mean the difference between finding addresses and bouncing mail. - domain names and computer names are frequently changed at sites, and there are delays in the propagation of this data. - addresses cannot be resolved when certain critical computers crash, such as the receiving computer or other computers involved in resolving names into addresses called `nameservers'. - a whole slew of problems is associated with `nameservers'; if they are not updated they will not find name addresses, and even the operation of what constitutes `updating' has different interpretations at different sites. the current internet mailing and addressing protocols are slightly anachronistic in that they were created when the network was somewhat obscure and not widespread, with only a fraction of the traffic it now sees. today a large proportion of internet traffic is email, comprising millions of messages. _____ <1.6> what is the future of identification on the internet? some new technologies and standards are introducing facial images and voice messages into mail and these will improve the sense of community that comes from the familiarity of identification. however, they are not currently widespread, require large amounts of data transfer, standardized software, and make some compromises in privacy. promising new cryptographic techniques may make 'digital signatures' and 'digital authentication' common (see below). also, the trend in usenet standards is toward greater authentication of posted information. on the other hand, advances in ensuring anonymity (such as remailers) are forthcoming. see below. privacy ======= _____ <2.1> what is `privacy' on the internet? generally, while `privacy' has multiple connotations in society and perhaps even more on the internet, in cyberspace most take it to mean that you have exclusive use and access to your account and the data stored on and and directed to it (such as email), and you do not encounter arbitrary restrictions or searches. in other words, others may obtain data associated with your account, but not without your permission. these ideas are probably both fairly limiting and liberal in their scope in what most internet users consider their private domains. some users don't expect or want any privacy, some expect and demand it. _____ <2.2> why is privacy (un)important on the internet? this is a somewhat debatable and inflammatory topic, arousing passionate opinions. on the internet, some take privacy for granted and are rudely surprised to find it tenuous or nonexistent. most governments have rules that protect privacy (such as the illegal search and seizure clause of the u.s. constitution, adopted by others) but have many that are antithetical to it (such as laws prohibiting secret communications or allowing wiretapping). these rules generally carry over to the internet with few specific rules governing it. however, the legal repercussions of the global internet are still largely unknown and untested (i.e. no strong legal precedents and court cases). the fact that internet traffic frequently passes past international boundaries, and is not centrally managed, significantly complicates and strongly discourages its regulation. _____ <2.3> how (in)secure are internet networks? - `theoretically' people at any site in the chain of sites with access to hardware and network media that transmits data over the internet could potentially monitor or archive it. however, the sheer volume and general 'noise' inherent to this data makes these scenarios highly improbable, even by government agencies with supposedly vast funding and resources. - technologies exist to `tap' magnetic fields given off by electrical wires without detection. less obscurely, any machine with a network connection is a potential station for traffic detection, but this scenario requires knowledge and access to very low-level hardware (the network card) to pursue, if even possible. - a company network general inc. is one of many that manufactures and markets sophisticated network monitoring tools that can 'filter' and read packets by arbitrary criteria for troubleshooting purposes, but the cost of this type of device is prohibitive for casual use. known instances of the above types of security breaches at a major scale (such as at network hubs) are very rare. the greatest risks tend to emerge locally. note that all these approaches are almost completely defused with the use of cryptography. _____ <2.4> how (in)secure is my account? by default, not very. there are a multitude of factors that may reinforce or compromise aspects of your privacy on the internet. first, your account must be secure from other users. the universal system is to use a password, but if it is `weak' (i.e. easy to guess) this security is significantly diminished. somewhat surprisingly and frighteningly to some, certain users of the system, particularly the administrator, generally have unlimited access regardless of passwords, and may grant that access to others. this means that they may read any file in your account without detection. furthermore, not universally known, most unix systems keep fairly extensive accounting records of when and where you logged in, what commands you execute, and when they are executed (in fact, login information is usually public). most features of this `auditing' or `process accounting' information are enabled by default after the initial installation and the system administrator may customize it to strengthen or weaken it to satisfy performance or privacy aims. this information is frequently consulted for troubleshooting purposes and may otherwise be ignored. this data tracks unsuccessful login attempts and other 'suspicious' activities on the system. a traditional part of the unix system that tracks user commands is easily circumvented by the user with the use of symbolic links (described in 'man ln'). unix implementations vary widely particularly in tracking features and new sophisticated mechanisms are introduced by companies regularly. typically system adminstrators augment the basic unix functionality with public-domain programs and locally-developed tools for monitoring, and use them only to isolate `suspicious' activity as it arises (e.g. remote accesses to the 'passwd' file, incorrect login attempts, remote connection attempts, etc.). generally, you should expect little privacy on your account for various reasons: - potentially, every keystroke you type could be intercepted by someone else. - system administrators make extensive backups that are completely invisible to users which may record the states of an account over many weeks. - erased files can, under many operating systems, be undeleted. - most automated services keep logs of use for troubleshooting or otherwise; for example ftp sites usually log the commands and record the domain originations of users, including anonymous ones. - some software exacerbates these problems. see the section on ``x windows (in)security''. indepedent of malevolent administrators are fellow users, a much more commonly harmful threat. there are multiple ways to help ensure that your account will not be accessed by others, and compromises can often be traced to failures in these guidelines: - choose a secure password. change it periodically. - make sure to logout always. - do not leave a machine unattended for long. - make sure no one watches you when you type your password. - avoid password references in email. - be conservative in the use of the .rhost file. - use utilities like `xlock' to protect a station, but be considerate. be wary of situations where you think you should supply your password. there are only several basic situations where unix prompts you for a password: when you are logging in to a system or changing your password. situations can arise in which prompts for passwords are forged by other users, especially in cases where you are talking to them (such as internet relay chat). also, be aware that forged login screens are one method to illegitimately obtain passwords. (thanks to jim mattson <mattson@cs.ucsd.edu> for contributions here.) _____ <2.5> how (in)secure are my files and directories? the most important privacy considerations are related to file rights, and many lapses can be traced to their misunderstood nature or haphazard maintenance. be aware of the rights associated with your files and directories in unix. if the `x' (`execute') right on your parent directory is off for users, groups, and other, these users cannot gain information on anything in your directories. anything less may allow others to read, change, or even delete files in your home directory. the rights on a directory supersede the rights associated with files in that directory. for a directory, 'x' means that access to the files (or subdirectories) in the directory is possible -- if you know their names. to list the contents of the directory, however, requires the 'r' right. by default most accounts are accessable only to the owner, but the initial configuration varies between sites based on administrator preference. the default file mode specifies the initial rights associated with newly created files, and can be set in the shell with `umask'. the details of rights implementations tend to vary between versions of unix. consult man pages on `chmod' and `ls'. examples -------- traver.lance % ls -ld ~ drwx------ 15 ld231782 1536 jan 31 21:22 /users/ld231782/ here is a listing of the rights associated with a user's home directory, denoted by `~'. the columns at the left identify what rights are available. the first column identifies the entry as a directory, and the next three columns mean that read, write, and execute rights, respectively, are permitted for that user. for directories, the `x' right means that contents (file and subdirectory names) within that directory can be listed. the subsequent columns indicate that no other users have any rights to anything in the directory tree originating at that point. they can't even `see' any lower files or subdirectories; the hierarchy is completely invisible to them. traver.lance % ls -l msg -rw-r--r-- 1 ld231782 35661 jan 29 23:13 msg traver.lance % chmod u=rw,g=,o= msg traver.lance % ls -l msg -rw------- 1 ld231782 35661 jan 29 23:13 msg here the modes on the file `msg' were changed to take away rights from `group' and `other'. note that `ls -l <file>' requires both the 'r' right to get the list of files and subdirectories, and the 'x' right to access the files and subdirectories in order to get their size, etc. for example, suppose the directory `foo' has rights dr--r--r--, the following is possible: ls foo these commands would fail independent of file rights: ls -l foo ls -l foo/file cat foo/file cd foo if the directory `foo' has rights d--x--x--x, the following are possible if it is known beforehand that `foo' contains an 'r' readable file named `file': ls -l foo/file cat foo/file cd foo the following commands fail: ls foo ls -l foo (thanks to uwe waldmann <uwe@mpi-sb.mpg.de> for contributions here.) _____ <2.6> how (in)secure is x windows? x windows is the primary software developed by the mit athena project which is funded by u.s. government grants to develop applications to harness the power of networks in enhancing computational tasks, particularly the human-computer interface. the software implements a client-server interface to a computer via graphical windows. in this case the `client' is the application requesting or utilizing graphical resources (such as windows or a mouse) and the `server' is the machine that provides them. in many situations the client is an application program running on the same machine as the server. the great utility of x windows comes from its complete dissociation of the client and server so that windows may be `broadcast' to a server at a remote location from the client. unfortunately this dynamic power also introduces many deep, intricate, and complicated security considerations. the primary security and privacy issue associated with x windows is that much more sensitive data may be sent over a network, and over wider regions, than in the case where the human is situated near the host computer. currently there is no encryption of data such as screen updates and keystrokes in x windows. due to either intentional design decisions or unintentional design flaws, early versions of the x window system are extremely insecure. anyone with an account on the server machine can disrupt that display or read it electronically based on access to the device unix:0.0 by any regular user. there are no protections from this type of access in these versions. the problem arises because the security is completely based on machine addresses rather than users, such that any user at a `trusted' machine is himself trusted. quoting from x documentation (man xsecurity): > any client on a host in the host access control list is allowed > access to the x server. this system can work reasonably well in > an environment where everyone trusts everyone, or when only a > single person can log into a given machine...this system does not > work well when multiple people can log in to a single machine and > mutual trust does not exist. with the access control list, the `xhost' command may prevent some naive attempts (i.e. those other than the direct-access unix:0.0 evasion); the syntax as typed on the host machine is ``xhost +[name]'' where [name] is the domain name or internet address of an authorized client machine. by default clients running nonlocal to the host are disabled. public domain programs to disrupt a display momentarily (such as 'flip' or slowly mirror the screen image, or cause pixels to 'melt' down to the bottom) have been circulating on the internet among hackers for several years and played as pranks on unsuspecting or inexperienced users. much more serious security breaches are conceivable from similar mechanisms exploiting this inherent weaknesses. (the minimal, easily-bypassed `trusted' security mode of `xhost' has been jokingly referred to as ``x hanging open, security terrible.''). new versions of the x window system (x11r5 and higher) by default make server access as secure as the file system using a .xauthority file and 'magic cookies'. remote machines must have a code in the .xauthority file in the home directory that matches the code allowed by the server. many older programs and even new vendor-supplied code does not support or is incompatible with `magic cookies'. the basic magic cookie mechanism is vulnerable to monitoring techniques described earlier because no encryption of keys occurs in transmission. x11r5 also includes other sophisticated encryption mechanisms. try `man xsecurity' to find out what is supported at your site. even though improved security mechanisms have been available in x windows since ~1990, local sites often update this software infrequently because installation is extremely complex. (thanks to marc vanheyningen <mvanheyn@whale.cs.indiana.edu>, jim mattson <mattson@cs.ucsd.edu>, and bill marshall <marshall@cs.iastate.edu> for contributions here.) _____ <2.7> how (in)secure is my email? by default, not very. the characters that you are reading are almost certainly encoded in ascii, the american standard code for information interchange that maps alphabetic and symbolic characters onto numeric codes and vice versa. virtually every computer system uses this code, and if not, has ways of converting to and from it. when you write a mail message, by default it is being sent in ascii, and since the standard is virtually universal, there is no intrinsic privacy. despite milleniums worth of accumulated cryptographic knowledge, cryptographic technologies are only recently being established that afford high priority to privacy as a primary criteria in computer and network design. some potential pitfalls in privacy are as follows: - the most serious threats are instances of immature or unscrupulous system operators reading private mail in the `spool files' at a local site (i.e. at the source or destination of the message), such as a university. - system administrators may also release files to law enforcement agencies, but conventions and protocols for warrants involving computer searches have still not been strongly established and tested legally. - note that bounced messages go to postmasters at a given site in their entirety. this means that if you address mail with an incorrect address it has a good chance of being seen by a human other than the recipient. - typically new user accounts are always set up such that the local mail directory is private, but this is not guaranteed and can be overridden. - finally, be aware that some mailing lists (email addresses of everyone on a list) are actually publicly accessable via mail routing software mechanisms. this `feature' can be disabled. most potential compromises in email privacy can be thoroughly avoided with the use of strong end-to-end cryptography, which has its own set of caveats (for example, unscrupulous administrators may still be a threat if the encryption site is shared or nonlocal). see the sections on ``email privacy'' and ``email policies.'' _____ <2.8> how am i (not) liable for my email and postings? as punishment or whatever, your system administrator can revoke certain `privileges' such as emailing, usenet posting or reading certain groups, file transferring, remote communications, or generally any subset of capabilities available from your account. this all is completely at the discretion of the local administrator and under the procedures followed at a particular site, which in many cases are haphazard and crisis-oriented. currently there are virtually no widespread, uniform guidelines or procedures for restricting use to any internet services, and local administrators are free to make arbitrary decisions on access. today punitive measures are regularly applied in various situations. in the typical scenario complaint(s) reach a system adminstrator regarding abuses by a user, usually but not necessarily preceded by complaints to the user in email, regarding that person's objectionable email or postings. `abusive' posters to usenet are usually first given admonitions from their system administrators as urged by others on the `net'. (the debate persists endlessly on many newsgroups whether this is also used as a questionable means of attacking or silencing `harmless crackpots' or censoring unpopular opinions.) system administrators at remote sites regularly cooperate to 'squelch' severe cases of abuse. in general, however, by tradition usenet readers are remarkably tolerant of diverse views and uses of the system, but a colorful vocabularly of slang helps describe their alternatives when this patience is sapped: the options wielded by the individual user are to simply advance to the next message (referred to as ``hitting the `n' key''), or to `plonk' annoying posters (according to the hacker's dictionary, the sound a jerk makes at the end of a fall to the bottom of a kill file). in cases where punitive actions are applied, generally system administrators are least likely to restrict email. usenet postings are much more commonly restricted, either to individual users or entire groups (such as a university campus). restrictions are most commonly associated with the following `abuses': - harassing or threatening notes, `email terrorism' - illegal uses, e.g. piracy or propagation of copyrighted material - `ad hominem' attacks, i.e. insulting the reputation of the poster instead of citing the content of the message - intentional or extreme vulgarity and offensiveness - inappropriate postings, esp. binary files in regular groups `mail-bombing': inundating mail boxes with numerous or massive files major problems originate from lack of distinctions in private and official email or postings. most users have internet access via accounts at businesses or universities and their activities on the internet can be construed as representative of their parent organizations. many people put disclaimers in their `signatures' in an attempt dissociate their identity and activities from parent organizations as a precaution. a recent visible political case involves the privacy of electronic mail written by white house staff members of the bush administration. following are some guidelines: - acquaint yourself with your company or university policy. - if possible, avoid use of your company email address for private communication. - use a disclaimer. - keep a low profile (avoid `flamewars' or simply don't post). - avoid posting information that could be construed to be proprietary or `internal'. the following references are available from ftp.eff.com (see also the section on ``internet use policies''): /pub/academic/banned.1991 /pub/academic/banned.1992 --- computer material that was banned/challenged in academia in 1991 and 1992 including usenet hierarchies. /pub/academic/cases --- this is an on-line collection of information about specific computers and academic freedom cases. file readme is a detailed description of the items in the directory. /pub/academic/faq/netnews.liability --- notes on university liability for usenet. _____ <2.9> how do i provide more/less information to others on my identity? the public information of your identity and account is mostly available though the unix utility `finger' described above. - you have control over most of this information with the utility `chfn', the specifics vary between sites (on some systems use `passwd -f'). - you can provide unlimited information in the .plan file which is copied directly to the destination during the fingering. - a technique that works at some sites allows you to find out who is 'finger'ing you and even to vary the .plan file sent to them. - your signature is determined by the environment variable signature - usenet signatures are conventionally stored in the .signature file in your home directory. providing less information on your online identity is more difficult and involved. one approach is to ask your system adminstrator to change or delete information about you (such as your full name). you may be able to obtain access on a public account or one from someone unrelated to you personally. you may be able to remotely login (via modem or otherwise) to computers that you are not physically near. these are tactics for hiding or masking your online activities but nothing is foolproof. consult man pages on the 'chmod' command and the default file mode. generally, files on a shared system have good safeguards within the user pool but very little protection is possible from corrupt system administrators. to mask your identity in email or on usenet you can use different accounts. more untraceable are new `anonymous posting' and remailing services that are very recently being established. see below. ______ <2.10> who is my sysadmin? what does s/he know about me? the requirements and screening for getting a system administration job (and thereby access to all information on a system) vary widely between sites and are sometimes frighteningly lax, especially at universities. many unix systems at universities are largely managed by undergraduates with a background in computing and often `hacking'. in general, commercial and industrial sites are more strict on qualifications and background, and government sites are extremely strict. the system adminstrator (root user) can monitor what commands you used and at what times. s/he may have a record (backups) of files on your account over a few weeks. s/he can monitor when you send email or post usenet messages, and potentially read either. s/he may have access to records indicating what hosts you are using, both locally and elsewhere. administrators sometimes employ specialized programs to track `strange' or `unusual' activity, which can potentially be misused. ______ <2.11> why is privacy (un)stable on the internet? for the numerous reasons listed above, privacy should not be an expectation with current use of the internet. furthermore, large parts of the internet are funded by the u.s. nsf (national science foundation) which places certain restrictions on its use (such as prohibiting commercial use). some high-level officials in this and other government agencies may be opposed to emerging techniques to guarantee privacy (such as encryption and anonymous services). historically the major threats to privacy on the internet have been local. perhaps the most common example of this are the widespread occurrences of university administrators refusing to carry some portion of usenet newsgroups labelled as `pornographic'. the `alternative' hierarchy in the usenet system, which has virtually no restrictions on propagation and new group creation, is frequently targeted (although this material may appear anywhere). from the global point of view traffic is generally completely unimpeded on the internet and only the most egregious offenders are pursued. for example, verbatim transcriptions of copyrighted material (such as newspaper or magazine articles) are posted to usenet with regularity without major consequences (some email complaints may ensue). more astonishing to some is that currently significant portions of usenet traffic, and less so internet traffic, is comprised of sexually-explicit digitized images almost entirely originating from copyrighted material (newsgroups such as `alt.sex' regularly have the highest traffic). ______ <2.12> what is the future of privacy on the internet? some argue that the internet currently has an adequate or appropriate level of privacy. others will argue that as a prototype for future global networks it has woefully inadequate safeguards. the internet is growing to become a completely global, international superhighway for data, and this traffic will inevitably entail data such as voice messages, postal mail, and many other items of extremely personal nature. computer items that many people consider completely private (such as their local hard drives) will literally be inches from global network connections. also, sensitive industrial and business information is exchanged over networks currently and this volume may conceivably merge with the internet. most would agree that, for these basic but sensitive uses of the internet, no significant mechanisms are currently in place to ensure much privacy. new standards are calling for uniform introduction of `privacy enhanced mail' (pem) which uses encryption technologies to ensure privacy, so that privacy protection is automatic, and may significantly improve safeguards. the same technology that can be extremely destructive to privacy (such as with surreptitious surveilance) can be overwhelmingly effective in protecting it (e.g. with encryption). some government agencies are opposed to unlimited privacy in general, and believe that it should lawfully be forfeited in cases of criminal conduct (e.g. court-authorized wiretapping). however, powerful new technologies to protect privacy on computers are becoming increasingly popular, provoking some to say that ``the cat is out of the bag'' and the ``genie can't be put back in the bottle''. in less idiomatic terms, they believe that the spread of strong cryptography is already underway will be socially and technically unstoppable. to date, no feasible system that guarantees both secure communication and government oversight has been proposed (the two goals are largely incompatible). proposals for ``registration'' of secret keys (by d. denning on sci.crypt, for example) have been met with hot controversy at best and ridicule and derision at worst, mainly because of concerns for the right to privacy and objections of inherent feasibility. electronic privacy issues, and particularly the proper roles of networks and the internet, will foreseeably become highly visible and explosive over the next few years. anonymity ========= _____ <3.1> what is `anonymity' on the internet? simply stated, anonymity is the absence of identity, the ultimate in privacy. however, there are several variations on this simple theme. a person may wish to be consistently identified by a certain pseudonym or `handle' and establish a reputation under it in some area, providing pseudo-anonymity. a person may wish to be completely untraceable for a single one-way message (a sort of `hit-and-run'). or, a person may wish to be openly anonymous but carry on a conversation with others (with either known or anonymous identities) via an `anonymous return address'. a user may wish to appear as a `regular user' but actually be untraceable. sometimes a user wishes to hide who he is sending mail to (in addition to the message itself). the anonymous item itself may be directed at individuals or groups. a user may wish to access some service and hide all signs of the association. all of these uses are feasible on the internet but are currently tricky to carry out in practice, because of all the tracking mechanisms inherent to operating systems and network protocols. officials of the nsf and other government agencies may be opposed to any of these uses because of the potential for abuse. nevertheless, the inherent facelessness of large networks will always guarantee a certain element of anonymity. _____ <3.2> why is `anonymity' (un)important on the internet? anonymity is another powerful tool that can be beneficial or problematic depending on its use. arguably absence of identification is important as the presence of it. it may be the case that many strong benefits from electronic anonymity will be discovered that were unforeseen and unpredicted, because true anonymity has been historically very difficult to establish. one can use anonymity to make personal statements to a colleague that would sabotage a relationship if stated openly (such as employer/employee scenarios). one can use it to pass information and evade any threat of direct retribution. for example, `whistleblowers' reporting on government abuses (economic, social, or political) can bring issues to light without fear of stigma or retaliation. sensitive, personal, potentially damaging information is often posted to some usenet groups, a risky situation where anonymity allows conversations to be carried on completely independent of the identities of the participants. some police departments run phone services that allow anonymous reporting of crimes; such uses would be straightforward on the network. unfortunately, extortion and harassment become more insidious with assurances of anonymity. _____ <3.3> how can anonymity be protected on the internet? the chief means, as alluded to above, are masking identities in email and posting. however, anonymous accounts (public accounts as accessable and anonymous as e.g. public telephones) may be effective as well, but this use is generally not officially supported and even discouraged by some system adminstrators and nsf guidelines. the nonuniformity in the requirements of obtaining accounts at different sites and institutions makes anonymous accounts generally difficult to obtain to the public at large. many communications protocols are inherently detrimental to anonymity. virtually every protocol in existence currently contains information on both sender and receiver in every packet. new communications protocols will likely develop that guarantee much higher degrees of secure anonymous communication. _____ <3.4> what is `anonymous mail'? one approach to `anonymizing' mail has been to set up an `anonymous server' that, when activated by email to its address, responds by allocating and supplying an `anonymous id' that is unique to the person requesting it (based on his email address). this will vary for the same person for different machine address email originations. to send anonymous mail, the user sends email directed to the server containing the final destination. the server `anonymizes' the message by stripping of identification information and forwards the message, which appears to originate from the anonymous server only from the corresponding anonymous user id. this is the `interactive' use of anonymity or pseudonymity mentioned above. another more `fringe' approach is to run a `cypherpunk' remailer from a regular user account (no root system privileges are required). these are currently being pioneered by eric hughes and hal finney <hal@alumni.caltech.edu>. the operator runs a process on a machine that anonymizes mail sent to him with certain characteristics that distinguish it from his regular incoming mail (typically fields in the header). one has been implemented as a perl script running on unix. several of these are in existence currently but sites and software currently are highly unstable; they may be in operation outside of system administrator knowledge. the remailers don't generally support anonymous return addresses. mail that is incorrectly addressed is received by the operator. generally the user of the remailer has to disavow any responsibility for the messages forwarded through his system, although actually may be held liable regardless. these approaches have several serious disadvantages and weaknesses: - the anonymous server approach requires maintaining a mapping of anonymous id's to real addresses that must be maintained indefinitely. one alternative is to allow `deallocation' of aliases at the request of the user, but this has not been implemented yet. - although an unlikely scenario, traffic to any of these sites could conceivably be monitored from the `outside', necessitating the use of cryptography for basic protection,. - local administrators can shut them down either out of caprice or under pressure from local, network, or government agencies. - unscrupulous providers of the services can monitor the traffic that goes through them. - most remailers currently keep logs that may be inspected. - the cypherpunk approach tends to be highly unstable because these operators are basically network users who do not own the equipment and are accountable to their own system administrators, who may be unaware of the use and unsympathetic to the philosophy of anonymity when the operation is discovered, regarding it as illicit use. - in all cases, a high degree of trust is placed in the anonymous server operator by the user. currently the most direct route to anonymity involves using smtp protocols to submit a message directly to a server with arbitrary field information. this practice, not uncommon to hackers, and the approach used by remailers, is generally viewed with hostility by most system administrators. information in the header routing data and logs of network port connection information may be retained that can be used to track the originating site. in practice, this is generally infeasible and rarely carried out. some administrators on the network will contact local administrators to request a message be tracked and its writer admonished or punished more severely (such as revoking the account), all of this actually happening occasionally but infrequently. see the sections ``known anonymous mail and posting sites'' and ``responsibilities associated with anonymity''. _____ <3.5> what is `anonymous posting'? anonymous servers have been established as well for anonymous usenet posting with all the associated caveats above (monitored traffic, capricious or risky local circumstances, logging). make sure to test the system at least once by e.g. anonymous posting to misc.test (however some operators don't recommend this because many sites `autorespond' to test messages, possibly causing the anonymous server to allocate anonymous ids for those machines). see the ``responsibilties associated with anonymous posting'' before proceeding. another direct route involves using nntp protocols to submit a message directly to a newserver with arbitrary field information. this practice, not uncommon to hackers, is also generally viewed with hostility by most system administrators, and similar consequences can ensue. see the sections ``known anonymous mail and posting sites'' and ``responsibilities associated with anonymity''. _____ <3.6> why is anonymity (un)stable on the internet? as noted, many factors compromise the anonymity currently available to the general internet community, and these services should be used with great caution. to summarize, the technology is in its infancy and current approaches are unrefined, unreliable, and not completely trustworthy. no standards have been established and troubling situations of loss of anonymity and bugs in the software are prevalent. here are some encountered and potential bugs: - one anonymous remailer reallocated already allocated anonymous return addresses. - others passed signature information embedded in messages unaltered. - address resolution problems resulting in anonymized mail bounced to a remailer are common. - forgeries to the anonymous server itself are a problem, possibly allowing unauthorized users to potentially glean anon id - email address mappings in the alias file. this can be remedied with the use of passwords. - infinite mail loops are possible with chaining remailers. source code is being distributed, tested, and refined for these systems, but standards are progressing slowly and weakly. the field is not likely to improve considerably without official endorsement and action by network agencies. the whole idea is essentially still in its infancy and viewed with suspicion and distrust by many on the internet, seen as illegitimate or favorable to criminality. the major objection to anonymity over regular internet use is the perceived lack of accountability to system operators, i.e. invulnerability to account restrictions resulting from outside complaints. system adminstrators at some sites have threatened to filter anonymous news postings generated by the prominent servers from their redistribution flows. this may only have the effect of encouraging server operators to create less characteristically detectable headers. probably the least problematic approach, and the most traditional to usenet, is for individual users to deal with anonymous mail however they prefer, e.g. ignoring it or filtering it with kill files. _____ <3.7> what is the future of anonymity on the internet? new anonymous protocols effectively serve to significantly increase safeguards of anonymity. for example, the same mechanism that routes email over multiple hosts, thereby threatening its privacy, can also be used to guarantee it. in a scheme called `chaining' an anonymous message is passed through multiple anonymous servers before reaching a destination. in this way generally multiple links of the chain have to be `broken' for security to be compromised. re-encryption at each link makes this scenario even more unlikely. even more significantly the anonymous remailers could be spread over the internet globally so that local weaknesses (such as corrupt governments or legal wiretapping within a nation) would be more unlikely to sacrifice overall security by message tracing. however, remailers run by corrupt operators are possible. the future of anonymous services on the internet is, at this time, highly uncertain and fraught with peril. while specific groups seem to benefit significantly from anonymous posting capabilities, many feel that unlimited newsgroup scope for anonymous posting is a disruptive and dangerous idea and detracts from discussions in `serious' groups. the introduction of unlimited group anonymity may have fundamental repercussions on usenet conventions and distribution mechanisms such as moderated and `alt' groups have had in the past. for example, as part of new group creation, the charter may specify whether `anonymous' posting is (un)welcome. nevertheless, the widespread introduction and use of anonymity may be inevitable. based on traffic statistics, anonymous services are in huge demand. pervasive and readily available anonymity could carry significant and unforeseen social consequences. however, if its use is continued to be generally regarded as subversive it may be confined to the underground. the ramifications of widespread introduction of anonymity to usenet are still largely unknown. it is unclear whether it will provoke signficant amounts of new traffic or, instead of expansion, cause a shift where a greater portion of existing traffic is anonymized. conceivably the services could play a role in influencing future mainstream social acceptance of usenet. * * *",

            "i have been using the join command for many years now, mostly with good success in duplicating unix-style file mounts. you will hear lots of people cursing join because they confuse it with the dos append command (a truely gnarly hack), but don't believe them. you also will hear people saying that microsoft recommends that you not use join. but, in microsoft's windows 4 workgroups resource toolkit, the following appears: \"join, an ms-dos utility, works fine with windows for workgroups 3.1 if you do not change the state of the joined drives during a windows for workgroups 3.1 session. this includes adding or removing joined drives from within windows for workgroups. we recommend that you do not use join when running windows setup or windows for workgroups 3.1.\" within this caveat, join appears to be valid under windows. however, i have found a couple of applications that don't deal well with filesystems that have been \"mounted\" using join. in particular, the worst offender is word for windows 2.0x. it gets very confused when you edit and then try to save a file on a joined drive. it wants to create the saved file as ~nnnnn.tmp in the current dir, then delete the old file and rename the ~nnnnn.tmp file to the *.doc file. unfortunately, wfw usually writes the ~nnnnn.tmp file in some idiotic place other than the current directory (often in the root dir of the joined filesystem, but not always). then, after deleting the original *.doc file, it can't find the ~nnnnn.tmp file to rename it. unless you search your disk systems, the document is gone. i have also found subtle problems using the mks toolkit from a dos box when joined filesystems are present. i used to join c:\\temp with a 4meg ramdisk, but mks sometimes gets confused when doing an \"ls\" on the c:\\temp dir, and misses some files in the temp dir. (this is difficult to reproduce, but it goes away totally when join is not used.) i think this is a windows problem, rather than mks's, since it works ok under raw dos. so, i would suggest that you can use join, but be aware that it may not be as robust you would like. wouldn't it be real great to \"mount\" network drives (i.e. z:) under the main file tree, rather than having all those darned drive letters? unfortunately, join won't let you do it. there was talk on the net about a simple patch to let join work on network drives, but i don't remember the source. it's too bad the join command is not better implemented, since it would avoid using all those stupid drive letters. i realize that messdos was meant for casual, even ignorant users, so \"mounting\" all the drives in one file tree might be confusing. but, it looks like ms is going to carry this over into windows nt (another os meant for casual, even igorant users -- not!). with all it's old family system baggage, maybe ms needs a recovery group so they can get on with life :-(.",

            "i am not an expert in the cryptography science, but some basic things seem evident to me, things which this clinton clipper do not address. the all pertain to opportunites for abuse, and conclusions based on what i have seen the membership of this group (except for two notable persons) agree to. if anything bad is possible by the government in theory, it almost always ends up happening in fact. so the key is to make abuse impossible. question authority, and remember power does corrupt. i think one has to regard this whole idea in the sense that it will be expanded to include other data forms, such as data transfer and stored data. and as such should be treated as if it were expanded (or such expansion will be almost impossible to stop, using clipper as a precident). there was a hint of that in the proposal, remember. that said, please bear with me, i am not very articulate, so i take more words to say what others could say much more briefly. thank you. as i suggested this is now. the hint is in the proposal that this or similar proposals are being considered for other forms of encryptions such as data transfer, data files, and such, largely dependent on how this thing is accepted or flies. i think one would be wise to treat this in the manner one would when (not if) it gets expanded to other areas than cellular phones. i think this is guaranteed to happen, if this proposal gets by. salami politics. it has been and is used in several other areas, it is certain to be used here. government is not going to easily give up on the idea that they should be able to eavesedrop whenever they want to. 'court order required' has proven to be a rather flimsy guarantee. if the case warrants, they can always sieze the material, and force one to give the key, or sit in jail forever on periodically renewed contempt charges. so it is not denying the justice system the information, nor the ability to lock someone up if guilty (or refuses to divulge the means to access the info - this is not protected under the fifth - one can be forced to perform acts that would result in divulging incriminating evidence). so, blocking restrictions on private encryption is not preventing legitimate law enforcement - it does make illegitimate law enforcement a bunch more difficult. especially fishing expeditions without the target's knowlege. don't give up the right to be safe from that - that should be non-negotiable, and clinton and co. know it (which is probably why they quietly developed this thing, figuring if they get it this far, they can ram it on through). how come those consulted could be roughly described as \"us insiders\"? they cannot quietely impliment it though, when they ban other schemes to ensure its exclusive use. hence the nice pr document to try and reassure everyone. don't buy into it. has government really earned that kind of trust, past or future? to be secure and free, one must keep government honest and the only way to do that is to make abuse impossible, not 'unlikely' or 'difficult'. so what? one could use information gained by re-use of the keys (saved after the last case was finished) or other means (master key, backdoor, easily broken algorithm) to find other evidence which, given to a judge, would authorize a tap which wouldn't have been possible otherwise. this has been the more common manner of abuse of wiretaps in the past... for local cops, this might be workable to keep them honest, but the feds have a workaround somehow, bet on it. does anyone really believe for example, that the government will use a scheme nsa cannot listen in on scanning for keywords - either easily defeated in realtime or via a 'master key'? i sure don't. this whole thing sounds like something to eliminate the need to use old-fashioned police work to build a case. in the past, eavesdropping was rather easy (with or without a court order). i think the law enforcement community has become a bit spoiled, and will resist changes that require them to revert to using old-fashioned detective work. i just find it somewhat surprising coming from a bunch that cares so much about civil and individual rights, that \"puts people first\". the question is \"put people first\" to where? with the innards not being revealed, how is one to be sure there doesn't exist a 'master key' for use by nsa, etc (so they can do their keyword scan, etc on conversations they routinely monitor, without a specific court order)? remember, the cellular phone limitiation is only temporary. bet on it. and so far i have not heard about police telling people that they have been tapped and nothing incriminating was found. what is to keep them from simply keeping the keys on file for 'next time'? after awhile, they would have quite a collection. kept especially for folks they deem 'disruptive'. and if they get only one key, that would reduce the search space a lot, unless it is an rsa scheme. remember nixon years? need for court orders really slowed them down, didn't it? and unless the escrow accounts are not government controlled (fat chance! i see one ending up being under, say treasury, the other under justice :-)) it could be worth some serious bucks to some folks to get keys to a competitor's clinton clipper (or descendent when this idea is expanded to be used for all non-government encryption). enough bucks would get one the keys or the innards for this algorithm. perhaps not an important concern, but given past government behavior and the other problems... what will one do when it is expanded to data storage encryption? you can bet that if clipper is accepted, that will be next on the agenda. it is even hinted at in the proposal - read it carefully... expect the argumet \"well, if you got nothing to hide...\" fine. then using that argument, one should not object to video cameras being installed in every room of one's home. granted - an exteme expansion of the idea but the principle holds. private stuff should remain private, even from a govt fishing expedition. and laws/rules may change in the future as to 'safeguards'. when it comes to the fed government, safeguards are pretty meaningless, if they want to do/get something. don't work so hard to give up some rather treasured rights, or establish bad precidents, please. the price could be hell to pay, later. people would fight laws forbidding more now, but in, say two years, because we have this 'crisis' situation which must be addressed by some 'drastic action', just this added reasonable restriction will only bother those who have someting to hide... etc. please don't buy into it. if the clinton clipper is so very good, why not make its algrithm public so many people can exchange ideas and examine it, rather than a few isolated 'respected experts' (respected by whom? for what? perhaps a certain professor who likes key banks would be one of the selected experts... this does seem to expand on some ideas the person was advocating, if i recall :-). how would anybody know that what the experts examine is the same as what will end up being used in the clipper chip, if it is kept secret? perhaps the clipper will use a crippled version (with a 'master key' provision), or features not present in the version subjected for study and evaluation by the experts. and who chooses the expertes? the government? no conflict of interest there... :-) and isn't it a requirement for any decent encryption scheme that it not have its effectiveness reduced by having the algrorithm widely known? i was lead to believe that one should assume the other side has everything you have, except for the key(s)... i recall ideas presented to this group are rejected if a requirement exists the algorithm be secret... another question - since it is a safe bet this clipper thing would not be used for government security, they are regarding it as not real secure but \"good enough\" for common folk. i think i would like to see a full description (not a pr non-statement) of just what \"good enough\" means? i think when saying how strong it is, \"good enough\" really means \"not very\". the excuse that other countries have these restrictions is not acceptable: other countries do not have our bill of rights and constitution (which the people, not the governments, of those other countries often regard with envy - what we have as rights they have as revokable privileges). and if we expect to retain those rights and protections, we must not allow them to be gutted because we just gotta have this thing to 'fight crime'. we have allready have our bill of rights pretty much torn to shreds. we should not permit more weakining for yet another 'noble cause', instead we should be trying to repair the damage. our crime problem may have a number of causes, but \"too many rights and safeguards\" is not a signifigant one. a broken court system and poor police work are a much more signifigant cause as having \"too many rights\" (disregarding addressing the root causes for crime, etc). btw - those who suggest that this is just an attack on clinton, believe this: i would be going ballistic reagardless who seriously proposed this thing. it is just another step in a gradual erosion of our rights under the constitution or bill of rights. the last couple of decades have been a non-stop series of end-runs around the protections of the constitution. it has to stop. now is as good a time as any, if it isn't too late allready.",

why not do so? how? to the world? \"start in your family. be a good example. live the word.\" why worry if it is going to be of good use to many? \"the fruits, __leave them to the lord__, do not worry about anything or anyone but entrust yourself to the lord.\" although the holy mother does not insist because: \"you are free; i bow before the freedom which god gives you.\" but she follows this with: \"you are surprised because i say to you: decide for god and yet, see how you have lived this day.\" why does she constantly conveys: \"take this life toward god in the way as to __experience__ the lord himself in your __behavior__ and __not only__ when you pray\" or one time when we decide that we are saved, or talk/write about god, etc. the holy mother warns: \"satan (the serpent) is always trying to dissuade you to turn you away from my peace plan and prayer.\" (rev 12:17, the dragon became angry with the woman and went off to wage war against the rest of her offsprings, those who keep god's commandments, and bear witness to jesus.) do you have fear or hate for god's current messenger of true peace, love and our motherly protector from the anti-christ? the one who is being apprehensive of communism, wars, famine and other evils that the serpent brings upon us? this obedient and blessed new eve? the mother who warns us so we can be prepared and be strong against satan? haven't there been renewed faith, hope, love, peace and obedience wherever this messenger has shared her blessings and graces that god has given her in good purpose? why do we choose to be blind? why fear the truth that god has been giving us a chance and sharing christ's ever-forgetting forgiveness to us through the obedient mother? the mother who has been consecrated the task __to reverse__ the disobedient harm and example done by the ancient eve. she has been preparing the new eden with her immaculate heart. the new eden as sanctuary (the womb) for the next coming and judgement of the righteous by our lord, jesus christ; when the lamb marries his bride. shouldn't we give her a hand in her exhaustive job of preparing us for the second coming of her son as she has been conceived without sin to bear the son of god in her womb? why fear true peace, love and renewed faith and obedience to god that mary faithfully brings to god's children? she has been protecting the flock (the rest of the offsprings) from the greedy dragon so as to present more righteous members for her son's coming. not all apparitions and miracles that resulted from them are worthy of belief. with prayer and guidance from the holy spirit and, of course, approval of our church authorities, we should be aware of the true and divinely inspired ones; specifically, the ones which aligns with the scripture. also, our lady reminds us of recommendation of __silence__ in our prayers: \"if you speak unceasingly in your prayers, how will you be able to hear god? allow him room to answer you, to speak to you.\" she encourages us (with motherly nurturing) to continue in exuberant faith, hope and love to jesus, constantly. not with mere emotions, but with deep, constant obedience to jesus, her beloved son and acknowledgement of our need to have him as part of our lives. let's not wait to the last minute to renew our faith and the life that god wants us to live; when there won't be enough time or when it will be late. nowadays, mary says, \"pray, pray, pray for peace...reconciliation, my children.\" have peace within yourself first before you can promote peace to others. for without peace, you can not fully accept my son.\" and you think she's just an ordinary lady. not to me. she's our good mother/messenger from god and she is so nice enough to share god's kingdom to us through her son and experience it. with mary, we are assured that the lamb always succeeds. ----- note: all enclosed in quotes are from \"latest news of medjugorje\" number 10, june, 1991 by fr. rene' laurentin. -----",

12:00-2:45pm \"introduction to molecular biology for computer scientists\" prof. mick noordewier (rutgers university) this overview of the essential facts of molecular biology is intended as an introduction to the field for computer scientists who wish to apply their tools to this rich and complex domain. material covered will include structural and informational molecules, the basic organization of the cell and of genetic material, the \"central dogma\" of gene expression, and selected other topics in the area of structure, function, and regulation as relates to current computational approaches. dr. noordewier has appointments in both computer science and biology at rutgers, and has extensive experience in basic biological research in addition to his current work in computational biology. 12:00-2:45pm \"introduction to artificial intelligence for biologists\" dr. richard lathrop (mit & arris corp.) an overview of the field of artificial intelligence will be presented, as it relates to actual and potential biological applications. fundamental techniques, symbolic programming languages, and notions of search will be discussed, as well as selected topics in somewhat greater detail, such as knowledge representation, inference, and machine learning. the intended audience includes biologists with some computational background, but no extensive exposure to artificial intelligence. dr. lathrop, co-developer of ariadne and related technologies, has worked in the area of artificial intelligence applied to biological problems in both academia and industry. 3:00-5:45pm \"neural networks, statistics, and information theory in biological sequence analysis\" dr. alan lapedes (los alamos national laboratory) this tutorial will cover the most rapidly-expanding facet of intelligent systems for molecular biology, that of machine learning techniques applied to sequence analysis. closely interrelated topics to be addressed include the use of artifical neural networks to elicit both specific signals and general characteristics of sequences, and the relationship of such approaches to statistical techniques and information-theoretic views of sequence data. dr. lapedes, of the theoretical division at los alamos, has long been a leader in the use of such techniques in this domain. 3:00-5:45pm \"genetic algorithms and genetic programming\" prof. john koza (stanford university) the genetic algorithm, an increasingly popular approach to highly non-linear multi-dimensional optimization problems, was originally inspired by a biological metaphor. this tutorial will cover both the biological motivations, and the actual implementation and characteristics of the algorithm. genetic programming, an extension well-suited to problems where the discovery of the size and shape of the solution is a major part of the problem, will also be addressed. particular attention will be paid to biological applications, and to identifying resources and software that will permit attendees to begin using the methods. dr. koza, a consulting professor of computer science at stanford, has taught this subject since 1988 and is the author of a standard text in the field. 3:00-5:45pm \"linguistic methods in sequence analysis\" prof. david searls (university of pennsylvania) & shmuel pietrokovski (weizmann institute) approaches to sequence analysis based on linguistic methodologies are increasingly in evidence. these involve the adaptation of tools and techniques from computational linguistics for syntactic pattern recognition and gene prediction, the classification of genetic structures and phenomena using formal language theory, the identification of significant vocabularies and overlapping codes in sequence data, and sequence comparison reflecting taxonomic and functional relatedness. dr. searls, who holds research faculty appointments in both genetics and computer science at penn, represents the branch of this field that considers higher-order syntactic approaches to sequence data, while shmuel pietrokovski has studied and published with prof. edward trifinov in the area of word-based analyses. registration form mail,

            "the following is a juxtaposition of part of an ancient text known as \"de sacramentis\", usually attributed to st. ambrose of milan, and the canon of the traditional catholic mass of the roman rite. the conclusion from this comparison is that the central part of the traditional roman canon was already fairly well in place by sometime in the late 4th century. taken from \"the mass of the western rites\", by the right reverend dom fernand cabrol, abbot of farnborough, 1934, without permission. excerpted from chapter vi: the mass at rome, from the fifth to the seventh centuries. the paragraph at the end is from the book, not me. sorry about the long lines. joe buehler ----- text of de sacramentis roman canon roman canon (about 400 ad) (1962 ad) (english translation) te igitur ...

            "forwarded from john spencer (spencer@lowell.edu): there will be two eclipses of iapetus by saturn and its rings, in may and july. please spread the word! here's some information about the events, and then a couple of messages from jay goguen of jpl appealing for thermal observations of the eclipse to learn more about the thermal properties of iapetus. he might also have some money available... john spencer, 1993/04/21 iapetus will be eclipsed by the shadows of saturn's rings and saturn itself on 1993/05/01-02 (18:27-13:43 ut) and again on 1993/07/20-21, (21:16-09:38 ut). timing is as follows; 1993 may 1-2 a-ring ingress 18:27 egress 19:30 b-ring ingress 19:51 egress 21:42 c-ring egress 23:00 saturn ingress 23:59 egress 10:02 b-ring ingress 10:28 egress 12:19 a-ring ingress 12:40 egress 13:43 1993 july 20-21 saturn ingress 21:16 egress 05:08 a-ring ingress 05:13 (grazing) egress 09:38 times could be 30 minutes later according to an alternate ephemeris, and photometric observations are important for refining iapetus' orbit. because the sun's size projected on the rings as seen from iapetus is 3100 km it's unlikely that we will learn anything new about the rings themselves from the observations. see soma (1992), astronomy and astrophysics 265, l21-l24 for more details. thanks to andy odell of northern arizona university for bringing the events to my attention. thermal observations? to me, the interesting thing to do would be thermal ir of the 20 july disappearance into the shadow of the planet to measure thermal inertia, etc. unfortunately, the 21:30 ut of this event renders it inaccessible, except from russia. even from calar alto, saturn is rising through 3 airmasses at 23:00 ut. do you know anyone in russia or ukraine with a big telescope and 10 um instrumentation that's looking for something to do? i'd be willing to make a personal grant of >$100 for the data. jay and again: please try to encourage anyone that can observe the iapetus planet disappearance to do so at thermal wavelengths. my impression would be that it's not an easy observation. iapetus will be faint and getting fainter in eclipse, so you'll need a big telescope that's a good ir telescope and reasonable 10 - 20 um instrumentation. i don't think that combination is widely available at the longitudes that are well placed for observation. we need sofia for this one. one possibility would be the ir telescope in india, but it's only a 1.2 m. jay",

            "i'm not sure who the \"original respondent\" was but to reiterate cones respond to particular portions of the spectrum, just as _rods_ respond to certain parts of the visible spectrum (bluegreen in our case, reddish in certain amphibia), just as the hoseshoe crab _limulus polyphemus_ photoreceptors respond to a certain portion of the spectrum etc. it is a common misconception to confound wavelength specificity with being color sensitive, however the two are not synonymous. so in sum and to beat a dead horse: (1) when the outputs of a cone are matched for number of absorbed photons _irrespective_ of the absorbed photons wavelength, the cone outputs are _indistinguishable_. (2) cones are simply detectors with different spectral sensitivities and are not any more \"color sensitive\" than are rods, ommatidia or other photoreceptors. (3) color vision arises because outputs of receptors which sample different parts of the spectrum (cones in this case) are \"processed centrally\". (the handwave is intentional) i've worked and published research on rods and cones for over 10 years so the adherence to the belief that cones can \"detect color\" is frustrating. but don't take my word for it. i'm reposting a few excellent articles together with two rather good but oldish color vision texts. the texts: robert boynton (1979) _human color vision_ holt, rhiehart and winston leo m. hurvich (1981) _color vision_, sinauer associates. the original articles: baylor and hodgkin (1973) detection and resolution of visual stimuli by turtle phoreceptors, _j. physiol._ 234 pp163-198. baylor lamb and yau (1978) reponses of retinal rods to single photons. _j. physiol._ 288 pp613-634. schnapf et al.

            "how can >this possibly be fair to the infants? what do you mean fair? god is just, giving to everyone what they deserve. as all infants are in sin from the time of conception (cf romans 5.12, psalm 1.7), they cannot possibly merit heaven, and as purgatory is for the purging of temporal punishment and venial sins, it is impossible that origianl sin can be forgiven. hence, the unbaptized infants are cut off from the god against whom they, with the whole of the human race except mary, have sinned. which is why jesus said, \"truly, truly i say to you, no one can enter the kingdom of god unless he is born of water and spirit\" which is the true meaning of born again (john 3.5). thus, as infants are in sin, it is very fair for them to be cut off from god and exlcuded from heaven. as st. augustine said, \"i did not invent original sin, which the catholic faith holds from ancient time; but you, who deny it, without a doubt are a follower of a new heresy.\" (de nuptiis, lib. 11.c.12)",

however, the number of reported cases with race not specified increased 88% from 1991 to 1992 and constituted 9.7% of all reported cases in 1992. although the largest proportional increases by age groups occurred among persons aged 35-44 years (80.4%) and greater than or equal to 45 years (87.7%), these age groups accounted for only 11.0% of all reported cases in 1992. persons in the 15-19-year age group accounted for the largest number of reported cases of gonorrhea during 1992 and the highest age group-specific rate (639 per 100,000). reported cases of gonorrhea increased 32.9% in the five-county denver metropolitan area (1990 population: 1,629,466) but decreased elsewhere in the state (table 1). half the cases of gonorrhea in the denver metropolitan area occurred in 8.4% (34) of the census tracts; these represent neighborhoods considered by sexually transmitted diseases (stds)/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (aids) field staff to be the focus of gang and drug activity. when compared with 1991, the number of gonorrhea cases diagnosed among men in the denver metro health clinic (dmhc, the primary public std clinic in the denver metropolitan area) increased 33% in 1992, and the number of visits by males to the clinic increased 2.4%. concurrently, the number of cases diagnosed among women increased by 1%. among self-identified heterosexual men, the number of gonorrhea cases diagnosed at dmhc increased 33% and comprised 94% of all cases diagnosed in males, while the number of cases diagnosed among self-identified homosexual men remained low (71 and 74 in 1991 and 1992, respectively). four selected laboratories in the metropolitan denver area (i.e., hmo, university hospital, nonprofit family planning, and commercial) were contacted to determine whether gonorrhea culture-positivity rates increased. gonorrhea culture-positivity rates in three of four laboratories contacted increased 23%-33% from 1991 to 1992, while the rate was virtually unchanged in the fourth (i.e., nonprofit family planning). from 1985 through 1991, reported cases of gonorrhea among whites and hispanics in colorado decreased; in comparison, reported cases among blacks hicnet medical newsletter page 14 volume 6, number 10 april 20, 1993 increased since 1988 (figure 1). during 1988-1992, the population in colorado increased 9.9% for blacks, 9.8% for hispanics, and 4.5% for whites. in 1992, the gonorrhea rate for blacks (1935 per 100,000 persons) was 57 times that for whites (34 per 100,000) and 12 times that for hispanics (156 per 100,000) (table 1). among black females, reported cases of gonorrhea increased from 1988 through 1992 in the 15-19-year age group; among black males, cases increased from 1989 through 1992 in both the 15-19-and 20-24-year age groups. reported by: ka gershman, md, jm finn, ne spencer, msph, std/aids program; re hoffman, md, state epidemiologist, colorado dept of health. jm douglas, md, denver dept of health and hospitals. surveillance and information systems br, div of sexually transmitted diseases and hiv prevention, national center for prevention svcs, cdc. editorial note: the increase in reported gonorrhea cases in colorado in 1992 may represent an overall increase in the occurrence of this disease or more complete reporting stimulated by visitations to laboratories by cdh surveillance staff during 1991-1992. the increases in confirmed gonorrhea cases at dmhc and in culture-positivity rates in three of four laboratories suggest a real increase in gonorrhea rather than a reporting artifact. however, the stable culture-positivity rate in the nonprofit family planning laboratory (which serves a network of clinics statewide) indicates that the gonorrhea increase did not uniformly affect all segments of the population. one possible explanation for the increased occurrence of gonorrhea in colorado may be gang- and drug-related sexual behavior, as implicated in a recent outbreak of drug-resistant gonorrhea and other stds in colorado springs (2). although the high morbidity census tracts in the denver metropolitan area coincide with areas of gang and drug activity, this hypothesis requires further assessment. to examine the possible role of drug use -- implicated previously as a factor contributing to the national increase in syphilis (3-6) -- the cdh std/aids program is collecting information from all persons in whom gonorrhea is diagnosed regarding drug use, exchange of sex for money or drugs, and gang affiliation. the gonorrhea rate for blacks in colorado substantially exceeds the national health objective for the year 2000 (1300 per 100,000) (objective 19.1a) (7). race is likely a risk marker rather than a risk factor for gonorrhea and other stds. risk markers may be useful for identifying groups at greatest risk for stds and for targeting prevention efforts. moreover, race- specific variation in std rates may reflect differences in factors such as socioeconomic status, access to medical care, and high-risk behaviors. in response to the increased occurrence of gonorrhea in colorado, interventions initiated by the cdh std/aids program include 1) targeting partner notification in the denver metropolitan area to persons in groups at increased risk (e.g., 15-19-year-old black females and 20-24-year-old black males); 2) implementing a media campaign (e.g., public service radio hicnet medical newsletter page 15 volume 6, number 10 april 20, 1993 announcements, signs on city buses, newspaper advertisements, and posters in schools and clinics) to promote awareness of std risk and prevention targeted primarily at high-risk groups, and 3) developing teams of peer educators to perform educational outreach in high-risk neighborhoods. the educational interventions are being developed and implemented with the assistance of members of the target groups and with input from a forum of community leaders and health-care providers. references 1. cdc. table ii. cases of selected notifiable diseases, united states, weeks ending december 26, 1992, and december 28, 1991 (52nd week). mmwr 1993;41:975. 2. cdc. gang-related outbreak of penicillinase-producing neisseria gonorrhoeae and other sexually transmitted diseases -- colorado springs, colorado, 1989- 1991. mmwr 1993;42:25-8. 3. cdc. relationship of syphilis to drug use and prostitution -- connecticut and philadelphia, pennsylvania. mmwr 1988;37:755-8, 764. 4. rolfs rt, goldberg m, sharrar rg. risk factors for syphilis: cocaine use and prostitution. am j public health 1990;80:853-7. 5. andrus jk, fleming dw, harger dr, et al. partner notification: can it control epidemic syphilis? ann intern med 1990;112:539-43. 6. gershman ka, rolfs rt. diverging gonorrhea and syphilis trends in the 1980s: are they real? am j public health 1991;81:1263-7. 7. public health service. healthy people 2000: national health promotion and disease prevention objectives--full report, with commentary. washington, dc: us department of health and human services, public health service, 1991;

than 11 years of age -- selected states, 1988 and 1989 ====================================================== source: mmwr 42(14) date: apr 16, 1993 motor-vehicle crashes are the leading cause of death among children and young adults in the united states and account for more than 1 million years of potential life lost before age 65 annually (1). child safety seats and safety belts can substantially reduce this loss (2). from 1977 through 1985, all 50 states passed legislation requiring the use of child safety seats or safety belts for children. although these laws reduce injuries to young children by an estimated 8%-59% (3,4), motor-vehicle crash-related injuries remain a major cause of disability and death among u.s. children (1), while the use of occupant restraints among children decreases inversely with age (84% usage for those aged 0-4 years; 57%, aged 5-11 years; and 29%, aged 12-18 years) (5). in addition, parents who do not use safety belts themselves are less likely to use restraints for their children (6). to characterize the association between adult safety-belt use and adult-reported consistent use of occupant restraints for the youngest child aged less than 11 years within a household, cdc analyzed data obtained from the behavioral risk factor surveillance system (brfss) during 1988 and 1989. this report summarizes the findings from this study. data were available for 20,905 respondents aged greater than or equal to 18 years in 11 states * that participated in brfss -- a population-based, random-digit-dialed telephone survey -- and administered a standard injury control and child safety module developed by cdc. of these respondents, 5499 (26%) had a child aged less than 11 years in their household. each respondent was asked to specify the child's age and the frequency of restraint use for that child. the two categories of child restraint and adult safety-belt use in this analysis were 1) consistent use (i.e., always buckle up) and 2) less than consistent use (i.e., almost always, sometimes, rarely, or never buckle up). data were weighted to provide estimates representative of each state. software for survey data analysis (sudaan) (7) was used to calculate point estimates and confidence intervals. statistically significant differences were defined by p values of less than 0.05. each of the 11 states had some type of child restraint law. of these, six (arizona, kentucky, maine, nebraska, rhode island, and west virginia) had no law requiring adults to use safety belts; four (idaho, maryland, pennsylvania, and washington) had a secondary enforcement mandatory safety-belt law (i.e., a vehicle had to be stopped for a traffic violation before a citation for nonuse of safety belts could be issued); and one state (new york) had a primary enforcement mandatory safety-belt law (i.e., vehicles could be stopped for a safety-belt law violation alone). in nine states, child-passenger protection hicnet medical newsletter page 17 volume 6, number 10 april 20, 1993 laws included all children aged less than 5 years, but the other two states used both age and size of the child as criteria for mandatory restraint use. the analysis in this report subgrouped states into 1) those having a law requiring adult safety-belt use (law states), and 2) those without such a law (no-law states). overall, 21% of children aged less than 11 years reportedly were not consistently restrained during automobile travel. both child restraint use and adult restraint use were significantly higher (p less than 0.05, chi-square test) in law states than in no-law states (81.1% versus 74.3% and 58.7% versus 43.2%, respectively). high rates of restraint use for children aged less than or equal to 1 year were reported by both adults indicating consistent and less than consistent safety-belt use (figure 1). adults with consistent use reported high rates of child-occupant restraint use regardless of the child's age (range: 95.5% for 1-year-olds to 84.7% for 10-year-olds). in comparison, for adults reporting less than consistent safety-belt use, the rate of child- occupant restraint use declined sharply by the age of the child (range: 93.1% for 1-year-olds to 28.8% for 10-year-olds). when comparing children of consistent adult safety-belt users with children of less than consistent adult safety-belt users, 95% confidence intervals overlap for the two youngest age groups (i.e., aged less than 1 and 1 year). reported child-occupant restraint use in law states generally exceeded that in no-law states, regardless of age of child (table 1). in addition, higher adult educational attainment was significantly associated with increased restraint use for children, a factor that has also been associated with increased adult safety-belt use (8). reported by: national center for injury prevention and control; national center for chronic disease prevention and health promotion, cdc. editorial note: the findings in this report are consistent with others indicating that adults who do not use safety belts themselves are less likely to employ occupant restraints for their children (6,9). because these nonbelted adults are at increased risk of crashing and more likely to exhibit other risk-taking behaviors, children traveling with them may be at greater risk for motor-vehicle injury (10). educational attainment of adult respondents was inversely associated with child restraint use in this report. accordingly, occupant-protection programs should be promoted among parents with low educational attainment. because low educational attainment is often associated with low socioeconomic status, such programs should be offered to adults through health-care facilities that serve low-income communities or through federal programs (i.e., head start) that are directed at parents with young children. injury-prevention programs emphasize restraining young children. in addition, however, efforts must be intensified to protect child occupants as hicnet medical newsletter page 18 volume 6, number 10 april 20, 1993 they become older. parents, especially those with low educational attainment, those who do not consistently wear safety belts, and those from states that do not have mandatory safety-belt use laws, should be encouraged to wear safety belts and to protect their children by using approved child safety seats and safety belts. finally, the increased use of restraints among children may increase their likelihood of using safety belts when they become teenagers -- the age group characterized by the lowest rate of safety-belt use and the highest rate of fatal crashes (5). references 1. cdc. childhood injuries in the united states. am j dis child 1990;144:627- 46. 2. partyka sc. papers on

separate cover as part of the mmwr series. each report published in the cdc surveillance summaries focuses on public health surveillance; surveillance findings are reported for a broad range of risk

areas -- united states, 1983-88 problem/condition: cdc and some states have developed surveillance systems to monitor the birth prevalence of major defects. reporting period covered: this report covers birth defects surveillance in metropolitan atlanta, georgia, and selected jurisdictions in california for the years 1983-1988. description of system: the california birth defects monitoring program and the metropolitan atlanta congenital defects program are two population- based surveillance systems that employ similar data collection methods. the prevalence estimates for 44 diagnostic categories were based on data for 1983- 1988 for 639,837 births in california and 152,970 births in metropolitan atlanta. the prevalences in the two areas were compared, adjusting for race, sex, and maternal age by using poisson regression. results: regional differences in the prevalence of aortic stenosis, fetal alcohol syndrome, hip dislocation/dysplasia, microcephalus, obstruction of the kidney/ureter, and scoliosis/lordosis may be attributable to general diagnostic variability. however, differences in the prevalences of arm/hand limb reduction, encephalocele, spina bifida, or trisomy 21 (down syndrome) are probably not attributable to differences in ascertainment, because these defects are relatively easy to diagnose. interpretation: regional differences in prenatal diagnosis and pregnancy termination may affect prevalences of trisomy 21 and spina bifida. however, the reason for differences in arm/hand reduction is unknown, but may be related to variability in environmental exposure, heterogeneity in the gene pool, or random variation. actions taken: because of the similarities of these data bases, several collaborative studies are being implemented. in particular, the differences in the birth prevalence of spina bifida and down syndrome will focus attention on the impact of prenatal diagnosis. authors: jane schulman, ph.d., nancy hicnet medical newsletter page 21

spread of new influenza virus variants and the impact of influenza on morbidity and mortality annually from october through may. reporting period covered: this report covers u.s. influenza surveillance conducted from october 1988 through may 1989. description of system: weekly reports from the vital statistics offices of 121 cities provided an index of influenza's impact on mortality; 58 who collaborating laboratories reported weekly identification of influenza viruses; weekly morbidity reports were received both from the state and territorial epidemiologists and from 153 sentinel family practice physicians. nonsystematic reports of outbreaks and unusual illnesses were received throughout the year. results: during the 1988-89 influenza season, influenza a(h1n1) and b viruses were identified in the united states with essentially equal frequency overall, although both regional and temporal patterns of predominance shifted over the course of the season. throughout the season increases in the indices of influenza morbidity in regions where influenza a(h1n1) predominated were similar to increases in regions where influenza b predominated. only 7% of identified viruses were influenza a(h3n2), but isolations of this subtype increased as the season waned, and it subsequently predominated during the 1989-90 season. during the 1988-89 season outbreaks in nursing homes were reported in association with influenza b and a(h3n2) but not influenza a(h1n1). interpretation: the alternating temporal and geographic predominance of influenza strains a(h1n1) and b during the 1988-89 season emphasizes the importance of continual attention to regional viral strain surveillance, since amantadine is effective only for treatment and prophylaxis of influenza a. actions taken: weekly interim analyses of surveillance data produced throughout the season allow physicians and public health officials to make informed choices regarding appropriate use of amantadine. cdc's annual surveillance allows the observed viral variants to be assessed as candidates for inclusion as components in vaccines used in subsequent influenza seasons. authors: louisa e. chapman, m.d., m.s.p.h.,

of public affairs at the university of arizona health sciences center. copyright 1993, the university of arizona high tech assisted reproductive technologies following the birth of the first in vitro fertilization-embryo transfer (ivf- et) baby in 1978, a host of assisted reproductive technologies have been developed that include ivf-et, gamete intrafallopian tube transfer (gift), embryo cryopreservation (freezing) and gamete micromanipulation. together, these technologies are referred to as the high-tech assisted reproductive technology (art) procedures. ovulation induction, sperm insemination and surgery for tubal disease and/or pathology still are the mainstays of the therapies available for infertility management. however, when these fail, it almost always is appropriate to proceed with one of the art procedures. therefore, in addition to a comprehensive basic and general infertility service at the university of arizona center for reproductive endocrinology and infertility, there is a program of assisted reproduction that specializes in art procedures. this program serves as a tertiary provider for those patients in the state of arizona whose infertility problems cannot be resolved by the traditional therapies. the following article (on back) describes the art procedures available in our center, clarifies appropriate applications for each, and considers the realistic expectations for their success. procedures included are: o in vitro o fertilization - embryo transfer (ivf-et), gamete intrafallopian tube transfer o (gift), cryopreservation of human embryos and gamete micromanipulation. this article also considers ongoing research in our program that is directed towards improved success of these technologies. hicnet medical newsletter page 24 volume 6, number 10 april 20, 1993 future areas of research in addition to ongoing research that is directed exclusively toward the management of infertile couples, we are developing the technology to assist couples who are at risk for producing embryos with a serious hereditary disease. this technology involves biopsying the preimplantation human embryo and then subjecting the biopsied cells to genetic analysis using either dna amplification or fluorescent in situ hybridization. there are recent reports of the successful application of dna amplification by other centers, for example, for diagnosis of the genes for cystic fibrosis and hemophilia. we hope to apply and further focus fluorescent in situ hybridization technology for probing the x chromosome, the identification of which will provide a scientific basis for counselling patients who exhibit sex-linked disorders. the considerable clinical application of such technology lies in the fact that it circumvents the need for prenatal diagnosis, in addition to the possibility of a subsequent termination of affected fetuses, in order to avoid the birth of affected children. catherine racowsky, ph.d. associate professor and director of research department of obstetrics and gynecology college of medicine university of arizona tucson, arizona applications, success rates and advances for the management of infertility the following are the art procedures available at the university of arizona center for reproductive endocrinology and infertility. in vitro fertilization - embryo transfer is the core art procedure of our assisted reproduction program. this procedure involves retrieval of unfertilized eggs from the ovary, their insemination in vitro in a dish, and the culture of resultant embryos for 1 or 2 days, before they are transferred to the patient's uterus. all cultures are maintained in an incubator under strictly controlled atmospheric and temperature conditions. before being processed for use in insemination, semen samples are evaluated in our andrology laboratory using both subjective light microscopy and computer- hicnet medical newsletter page 25 volume 6, number 10 april 20, 1993 assisted semen analyses. to ensure an adequate number of eggs with which to perform ivf-et, or indeed, gift, follicular development is typically stimulated, with gonadotropins (perganol, metrodin), gonadotropin releasing hormone (gnrh, factrel, lutrepulse) and/or gnrh analogues (lupron, depo lupron, synarel). occasionally, however, ivf-et is accomplished with eggs obtained in non-stimulated cycles. while some programs utilize laparoscopic egg retrieval in the operating room with the patient under general anesthesia, we undertake the less costly approach of ultrasound-guided retrieval in our infertility unit, with the patient sedated. couples who resort to ivf-et exhibit such pathologies as tubal deficiencies, ovulatory dysfunction, endometriosis, and/or mild forms of male factor infertility. according to the united states ivf registry, the overall success rate for ivf-et nationwide has stabilized at about 14 percent per cycle. results from our program, involving 86 patients who have undergone 173 ivf-et cycles, reflect a comparable success rate. nevertheless, the overall incidence of success with this procedure is disconcertingly low and emphasizes the need to address those physiological factors that limit achievement of a higher percentage of pregnancies. well recognized predictors of outcome include patient age, response to exogenous ovarian stimulation, quality of sperm and number of repeated ivf-et cycle attempts. however, among these, age is the single most significant determinant of conception. therefore, it is critical that such patients are referred to an assisted reproduction program at the earliest opportunity following failure of traditional therapies. the underlying basis for the negative effect of age on fertility has not been clearly delineated beyond recognition that: 1) the number of eggs available for retrieval declines markedly with age; 2) fertilization rates significantly decrease in eggs retrieved from patients who are over 40 years; and 3) provided the appropriate hormonal background is present, age is unrelated to uterine competency to sustain pregnancy. ongoing research in our center, therefore, is investigating physiological changes in the egg that may be impacted by age. we have determined that more than 50 percent of eggs that fail to fertilize in vitro are chromosomally abnormal, and that a significant proportion of these abnormalities are accountable to patient age. currently, the only recourse for such patients is to use eggs obtained from a donor. our program has initiated recruitment of volunteer egg donors to satisfy the needs of a list of recipients interested in this form of therapy. gift - this high-tech art procedure is performed in the operating room, usually with the use of a laparoscope and, in contrast to ivf-et, involves introducing sperm and freshly retrieved eggs into the lumen of the fallopian tube (an average of 3 eggs/tube). under these circumstances, fertilization occurs in vivo and, if excess eggs are retrieved, the remainder undergo ivf, with subsequent options for embryo transfer in that cycle, or freezing for transfer in a subsequent cycle. this art procedure is applied to cases in hicnet medical newsletter page 26 volume 6, number 10 april 20, 1993 which there is at least one patent fallopian tube but the couple has such pathologies as ovulatory dysfunction, endometriosis, male factor infertility and/or idiopathic infertility. the data reported in the united states ivf registry for 1985 through 1990 indicate that the overall success rate with gift is higher than that obtained with the ivf-et technique (range of clinical pregnancies for gift is 24 to 36 percent and for ivf-et 14 to 18 percent). in view of this fact, one might expect more patients to be treated with gift than ivf-et. however, in our program we have taken into account three basic concerns which, while substantially reducing the number of gift cycles performed, benefit the patient. these concerns are: 1) the increased costs associated with performing a procedure in the operating room; 2) the risks, albeit minimal, of undergoing general anesthesia; and 3) the considerable benefits to be accrued from obtaining direct information on the quality and fertilizability of the eggs, and the developmental competency of resultant embryos. the increased success with gift undoubtedly reflects the artificial environment provided by the laboratory in the ivf-et procedure. between january 1, 1991, and december 31, 1992, we have performed a total of 12 gift cycles, with an overall success rate of 20 percent. embryo cryopreservation, or freezing, is applied in our program when embryos result from residual gift eggs or from non-transferred ivf embryos. this procedure not only provides patients with a subsequent opportunity for success at much reduced costs, but also circumvents the legal and ethical issues relating to disposal of supernumerary embryos. therefore, as stipulated by the american fertility society ethical guidelines for art programs, from both a practical and an ethical standpoint, all assisted reproduction programs should have the capability of cryopreserving human embrys. gamete micromanipulation - this art procedure, which is still very new, is applied to couples who are unaccepting of insemination with donor semen but who have severe male factor infertility (less than 10 million sperm/ml in combination with fewer than 20 perccent motile sperm, and/or less than 10 percent sperm with normal morphology). we are currently developing the procedure of sub-zonal insertion (szi), which entails injecting sperm under the coating around the egg, the barrier normally penetrated by the sperm through enzymatic digestion. available data from szi programs world-wide indicate that only 5 to 10 percent of szi cycles result in a pregnancy. this statistic undoubtedly relates to limitations imposed by abnormalities inherent in the sperm. therefore, we are currently focusing on the development of improved techniques for the recognition and selection of sperm chosen for manipulation. such efforts are unquestionably worthwhile in view of the fact that this technology offers the only realistic opportunity for severe male factor patients to establish conception. catherine racowsky, ph.d.

            "{sorry, harel et al, but our doctors and most hospitals are still private in canada as well as in much of western europe.} wrong. in better ec countries that use pure (but public) health insurance (like we use in canada) rather than self-enclosed hmo-like socialized medicine, 30% of our costs comes from private supplementary insurance and/or copayments. france magazine's summer 1992 edition has a fantastic presentation of their basic insurance coverage, including a sample chart of copayment percentages. for 1-30 days, you're covered for 80% of the public hospital rate, 100% afterward. with extra private insurance, you can get into a private hospital and be covered for any differences beyond the public hospital rate. the public insurance covers 100% beyond 30 days, or the same cash amount for a private hospital and the difference is paid out-of-pocket or according to your supplementary private insurance. over 2/3rds of french have some form of extra private insurance. so, 30% of health costs in europe are out of private funds and not gleaned from other taxes. the gdp figures are combined public and private expenditures for total outlay using the same methods that yield the 13-14% figure for the u.s. that the french had deductibles and copayments in their insurance fund is to their credit ... i am in the minority for advocating such back in canada (to make the canadian insurance look more like real health insurance -- which actually it is). the new reform party, a breakoff of traditionalists from the conservatives with a mildly \"libertarian\" faction, hold our public health insurance as an untouchable but that just a few people have to be reminded that it's not free (the average canadian/european is more fiscally naive than their american counterparts on issues like these). i'm one of the few people who favour copayments (forget about leftists, even our conservatives attack me for it on the canadian newsgroups) to make it look more like real insurance, 'cos the 100% insurance payment is hidden (unlike in france) and if you didn't know it, you'd believe it actually is socialized medicine (american conservatives/libertarians and canadian leftists are the only ones who seriously call it that). canadians aren't worried about the americans, who spend 14%; we're worried about the french and germans who spend 7% to our 9% ... so the insurance is looking at things that shouldn't be paid for out of general funds like physicals for insurance policies, sick notes, electrolysis, etc. the reason that the canadian health insurance hasn't spiralled out of control despite being open and universal is that unlike americans, there is no urge to spend all of your benefits' worth, and more if you can ... we're a different culture. \"managed care\" relies on hmo's, which are unknown in most western nations that use only public health insurance like canada, france and germany (i'm canadian, and my german father-in-law-to-be says of hmo/nhs approaches, \"we left that behind with east germany!\"). sure, hmo/nhs controls costs because you have managers strangling doctors with budget strings. in canada, we use the public health insurance approach as in france and germany, with all private doctors and both private and public hospitals. it is all pure insurance without hmo's. the divisions are different, with the germans using a couple hundred interlinked \"sickness funds\" over a century old while canada divides by their provinces (who run the insurance fund and set local fees with the doctors monopoly; federal funds cover the fees disbursed.) with such an open-ended system, it's no surprise that canada is #2 to the u.s. in costs; all-insurance is the most expensive way to go. the french and germans use the same approach but have larger populations in more compact geography to improve scales of economy. gld",

            "ok, let me see if i can get all this out concisely. i am on an information gathering venture regarding the various expressions of christianity/churches there are. my husband and i come from very different, but completely christian backgrounds. i was a lutheran when i met him and he was a born and raised church of christ member. at first i agreed with a lot of what the c of c was about, i wanted to move from the liturgical based lutheran church to something a little more biblical based. however over the last year, i've been regretting changing to the church of christ for a number of reasons - for one thing i am not a fundamentalist and believe that a few things in the bible are socio-cultural in nature and don't relate to the christian doctrine. one of my sorest spots is the role of women. i believe that through mary and other women, chris validated women as worthy disciples - but in the c of c the writings of paul are taken without exception and i am told that i am not an equal partner in my marriage but the lesser member, i am to submit to my husband in all things (if i hear that verse one more time....) and i am not to take an active role in anything which might be construed as putting me in authority over men (ie leading prayers, conducting bible studies etc). the last straw was when the elders at our church came down on one of our college groups because it was all-women and they wanted a man to lead the study. also my husband and i really resent the way everyone at our church feels that if you aren't a conservative republican - you aren't a real christian (i got told that nobody who voted for clinton should call themselves a christian). hence we are subjected during the service to long prayers calling for things we flatly dont agree with. we are also don't agree with the c of c's dread of any new \"movement\" being led by the young people. so, we have been church hunting with no success. i want a reasonably biblical based church where women are viewed as whole people no matter what their calling ( c of c really looked down on career women). christopher is looking for a church with deeply rooted religious convictions, with adult baptism and a church where the members still bring their bibles to service. we are so confused here and we're drifting around trying to find a place where we both feel loved and can express our faith honestly and without reservation. if anyone can point us in a direction we'd be thrilled! i'm afraid that it will be very hard for me to go back to c of c and even harder for me to stay churchless for long. any responses would be welcome the diel family",

            "the dea and other organizations would have the american people believe that we are winning the \"war on drugs\". i'm going to dispel the propaganda that the dea is putting out by showing you the drug war's *real* status. to help prove my assertions i've also posted two articles from usa today that clearly demonstrate that drug use among certain age groups *is* on the rise. if wod is working, as we're led to believe, then drug abuse should have gone down substantially by now. the reality is, is that it has not gone down very much. if anything, substance abuse is on the rise. i'm also going to supply a possible solution to this problem. the following text is an excerpt from an article about rock music and pot entitled \"hello again, mary jane\" which appears in the current issue of time magazine (april 19, 1993, p. 59). law-enforcement officials say pot advocates are just blowing smoke when they talk about the comeback of the weed. \"perhaps because of the change of administrations, the marijuana lobby is out in full force,\" says robert bonner, head of the drug enforcement administration. \"the fact is, they're losing the battle.\" in 1985 more than 23% of youths ages 12 to 17 said they smoked marijuana; in 1991 that figure was 13%, and bonner says it is still falling. bonner also offers a reminder that studies confirm such marijuana health risks as destruction of nerve cells in the brain and lung damage. the chart that follows was taken from the wednesday, april 14, 1993 issue of usa today (\"drug use up among u.s. eigth-graders\" by mike snider, p. 6d). adolescents' choices drugs used by eighth graders in the last month: estimated, per 100 students 1991 1992 pct. chg. alcohol 25.1 26.1 +4% cigarettes 14.3 15.5 +8% marijuana 3.2 3.7 +16% amphetamines 2.6 3.3 +27% lsd 0.6 0.9 +50% cocaine 0.5 0.7 +40% crack 0.3 0.5 +67% source: university of michigan institute for social research, 1993 report we are not winning the \"war on drugs\". i think you can see that one of the tactics that the dea employs to give people the impression that the \"war on drugs\" is being won is to selectively quote statistics--- only statistics that support their contention that drug use has gone down. the excerpt from time magazine that i included in this post is an excellent example of how organizations like the dea attempt to deceive the public. usage of *one* particular drug may have gone down but at the same time usage of other drugs may have gone *up* (a.k.a. substitution). also, drug usage among *one* particular age group may have gone down but drug usage among another age group may have gone *up*. therefore, if one takes a look at the big picture, taking into consideration *all* the statistics, then it's obvious that the so-called \"war on drugs\" is being lost. perhaps the drug war is being won as far as illegal drugs go, but if one factors in alcohol abuse, smoking, and use of inhalants, then the magnitude of the drug problem in this country can then placed in its true perspective. for those of you who don't consider alcohol to be a drug then try drinking a fifth of whiskey sometime and then come back and tell me that it's not a drug. agencies like the dea only go after *illegal* drugs. this is one of the reasons why the drug war is a fruitless attempt at preventing substance abuse---people will merely switch to another drug if the one they were using becomes scarce or unpopular. the solution to the drug abuse problem in this country may be to legalize some---not all---drugs whose toxicity has been shown to be within reasonable limits (you won't drop dead after using it a few times) and then couple this with a massive drug education program. the reason why i think legalization is *part* of the solution is because people seem to be able to easily obtain drugs despite the government's efforts to the contrary---the money spent on drug interdiction could be spent more effectively elsewhere (e.g., drug education). additionally, legalization would reduce crime because the profit motive would be taken out of drug trafficking which often goes along with other kinds of crime. not to mention the fact that addicts would have less reason to prey on innocent people for their money and posessions in order to support their expensive habit; legalization would cause the street price of drugs to fall substantially so drugs would be much more affordable to addicts. imho, the way to reduce substance abuse is to do to drugs what has been done to smokers: make drug use socially unacceptable rather than try to employ heavy-handed law enforcement and punish people by incarcerating them. as you already know, people in the u.s. smoke a lot less than they used to. this reduction in the number of smokers has been brought about by public awareness campaigns, laws restricting where people can light up, warning labels on cigarette packages, taxation on tobacco in order to reduce consumption, and so on. i propose that similar methods be used to reduce substance abuse after legalization has been carried out. they are as follows: * drugs being sold must come with clear, concise information which states the possible health hazzards involved with using this product and recommendations on how the drug should be used. things like dosage levels and how long the drug should be used ought to accompany the packaging the drug is contained in. * all drugs should be taxed at a rate that generates a lot of revenue but not so high as to encourage people to acquire drugs through illegal channels. part of the revenue collected from drug taxes should be used to fund drug education and law enforcement. * make it a felony to sell drugs to minors (people under the age of 18). anyone can sell drugs but they must not dodge paying the taxes on drugs or sell drugs with the warning information absent. failure to pay the appropiate taxes on drugs or omitting warning information should also be a felony. * establish a government agency whose job is to insure that the purity and safety of all drugs is as high as possible. this agency would try to prevent people from getting a hold of bad drugs---something that is a fairly serious problem now. i'm sure that many of the things i've discussed in this article have been hashed out before in this newsgroup. nevertheless, i thought it was a good idea to give my two cents (actually a buck and a half...) all at once so you could get a good idea of where i currently stand on wod. go ahead and tear into my post; i'm sure there is something in it that you may wish to take a different view on or flame. :) :) :) btw, i posted the articles from usa today to not only help prove my assertions but also to provide information on lsd usage among youths--- something which i noticed some posters to this group were interested in. scott kennedy, brewer and patriot",

            "introducing the back to the moon in congress: the next step the next key hurdle for the lunar resources data purchase act is introduction of the act in congress. at this point, many congresspersons have been approached about the bill. however, for a successful effort to pass the bill, we need the best possible congressperson to introduce the bill. due to his position as chair of the house committee on space and science, congressman george brown is the logical choice. he has a long record of support and interest in space development, and helped pass the launch services purchase act and the space settlements act. there is a small group of activists in southern california who have assisted george brown in his recent re-election campaigns. we are mobilizing this group to have them tell congressman brown about the back to the moon bill. we are also asking pro-space constituents to let him know that they care about getting america back to the moon. finally, there is a good chance that a nationwide alert for space activists to call or write george brown to have him introduce the back to the moon bill may be staged during late spring, 1993. all this should produce a positive reaction from brown's office. as more is known, it will be passed on. however, even if we are successful in getting him to support the bill, this alone will not ensure passage of the bill. for any bill to become law, one of three conditions must exist: either the bill must reflect widespread national support for an issue (such as extension of unemployment insurance benefits); be propelled by high-priced lobbyists (we're out of luck there); or have widespread support within congress, due to small, but widespread, constituent support. the latter is the path that we, by necessity, must choose. this means that the introduction of the lunar resources data purchase act must be immediately accompanied by a large number of congresspersons' sponsorship of the bill. to accomplish this, we need activists to ask their congressperson to support the lunar resources data purchase act - now. to wait until the bill is introduced is simply too late - it takes time to have a congressperson's staff review a bill. if your congressperson mentions that the bill is not yet introduced, please elicit their opinion of the bill as currently written. we appreciate all comments on the bill from activists and politicians. if you have yet to see the back to the moon bill, please request a copy by email (please include your u.s. postal service address), or contact your local chapter of the national space society).",

[3] \"to the government of aleppo. january 15, 1916. we hear that certain orphanages which have been opened receive also the children of the armenians. whether this is done through the ignorance of our real purpose, or through contempt of it, the government will regard the feeding of such children or any attempt to prolong their lives as an act entirely opposed to it purpose, since it considers the survival of these children as detrimental. i recommend that such children shall not be received into the orphanages, and no attempts are to be made to establish special orphanages for them. minister of the interior, talaat.\" [4] \"to the government of aleppo. collect and keep only those orphans who cannot remember the tortures to which their parents have been subjected. send the rest away with the caravans. minister of the interior, talaat\" [5] \"from the ministry of the interior to the government of aleppo. at a time when there are thousands of moslem refugees and the widows of shekid [fallen soldiers] are in need of food and protection, it is not expedient to incur extra expenses by feeding the children left by armenians, who will serve no purpose except that of giving trouble in the future. it is necessary that these children should be turned out of your vilayet and sent with the caravans to the place of deportation. those that have been kept till now are also to be sent away, in compliance with our previous orders, to sivas. minister of the interior, talaat\" [6] in 1926, halide edip (a pioneer turkish nationalist) wrote in her memoirs about a conversation with talaat pasha, verifying and \"rationalizing\" this ultra-national fascist anti-armenian mentality, the following: \"i have the conviction that as long as a nation does the best for its own interest, and succeeds, the world admires it and thinks it moral. i am ready to die for what i have done, and i know i shall die for it.\" [7] these telegrams were entered as unquestioned evidence during the 1923 trial of talaat pasha's, assassin, soghomon tehlerian. the turkish government never questioned these \"death march orders\" until 1986, during a time when the world was again reminded of the genocide of the armenians. for reasons known to those who study the psychology of genocide denial, the turkish government and their supporters in crime deny that such orders were ever issued, and further claim that these telegrams were forgeries based on a study by s. orel and s. yuca of the turkish historical society. if one were to examine the sample \"authentic text\" provided in the turkish historical society study and use their same forgery test on that sample, it too would be a forgery!. in fact, if any of the tests delineated by the turkish historical society are performed an any piece of ottoman turkish or persian/arabic script, one finds that anything handwritten in such language is a forgery. today, the body of talaat pasha lies in a tomb on liberty hill, istanbul, turkey, just next to the yildiz university campus. the body of this genocide architect was returned to turkey from germany during ww2 when turkey was in a heightened state of proto-fascism. recently, this monument has served as a focal point for anti-armenianism in turkey. this monument represents the epitome of the turkish government's pathological denial of a clear historical event and is an insult to a people whose only crime was to be born armenian. - - - references - - - [1] _the memoirs of naim bey_, aram andonian, 1919, pages 59-60 [2] ibid, page 60 [3] ibid, page 60 [4] ibid, page 61 [5] ibid, page 61 [6] ibid, page 62 [7] _memoirs of halide edip_, halide edip, the century press, new york (and london), 1926, page 387",

            "<moral driver distinctions deleted> compare the driver to an urge such as jealousy, where there is an urge and an \"object\". the jealousy does not technically exist until the object is apparent. however, the capacity to be jealous is presumably still there even though it is not detectable. your description of the unbilical took me three passes to understand (!) but i get the gist and i have to tentatively agree. i think our two definitions can sit side by side without too much trouble, though. i haven't attempted to define the reason behind the moral driver (only hinted through the essence of each moral). your definition hints that animals are also capable of a similar morality - simians have a similar social order to ourselves and it is easy to anthropomorphize with these animals. is this possible or have i misunderstood? my p.s. thoughts falls roughly in line with john stuart mill and his writings on utilitarianism. i have no particular plan (except to do my bit - personal ethics and social work). my opinion (for what it is worth) is that the authority for each moral must be increased somehow, and that this will probably take several generations to be effective. i don't think that the list of morals has changed for society significantly, though . the authority element may come from our authority figures and roles models (see eric berne and his transactional analysis work [+ mavis klein] for references) and this is what gives rise to a deterioration of moral standards in the long term. i've had some more thoughts on my definitions: i've was thinking that i should add moral character to the list of definitions in order to get a dynamic version of the moral nature (ie. the interplay of the moral code and associated authorities). a suitable analogy might be a graphic equaliser on a hifi system - the moral nature being the set of frequencies and the chosen 'amplitudes', and the moral character being the spectrum over time. conscience is a little more difficult because i can't define it as the reasoning of a person between actions in the context of his moral nature because conscience seems to cut in most of the time unbidden and often unwanted. i think conscience is manifest when a decision is made at a given time which compromises one's moral nature. my conscience fits in more with freud's superego (plus the moral driver) with the stimulous being the urges or freud's id. the reasoning that i mentioned before is freud's ego, i suppose. if the moral driver is part of the id then the reason why conscience cuts in unbidden is partially explained. the question is \"what provides the stimulous to activate the moral driver?\". i think i need some more time with this one. that's about it for now! david. --- on religion:",

(mechanism was not known but several plausible ones existed) (also to be fair it was noted that the _brightest_ burster was probably in the lmc, suggesting theorists might be wrong back then...) as the sun is not at the center of the galaxy a halo population should show anisotropy (a local disk population is ruled out completely at this stage) - to avoid the anisotropy you have to push the halo out, the energy then gets large, the mechanism of getting ns out that far becomes questionable, and we should start to see for example the andromeda's bursters. the data is consistent with either a oort cloud distribution (but only just) - but no one can think of a plausible source with the right spectrum. or, it can be a cosmological distances (hence isotropy) and the edge is \"the edge of the universe\" ;-) if at cosmological distances you need very high energy (to detect) and a very compact source (for spectrum), ergo a neutron star colliding with another neutron star or black hole. even then getting the spectrum is very hard, but conceivable. if we know anything about physics at that level, the bursters are not due to quantum black holes or cosmic strings, wrong spectrum for one thing. the situation is further complicated by recent claims that there are two classes of sources ;-) [in the colliding ns they'd actually probably fit relatively easily into the ns-ns and ns-bh collision scenarios respectively] my own pet theory is that it's flying saucers entering hyperspace :-) but the reason i am asking is that most everyone assumes that they are colliding nuetron stars or spinning black holes, i just wondered if any mechanism could exist and place them closer in. if you can think of one, remember to invite me to stockholm...",

            "the white house office of the press secretary (pittsburgh, pennsylvania) ______________________________________________________________ for immediate release april 17, 1993 interview of the president by michael whitely of kdka-am radio, pittsburgh pittsburgh international airport pittsburgh, pennsylvania 10:40 a.m. edt q for everyone listening on kdka radio, i'm mike whitely, kdka radio news. we're here at the pittsburgh international airport and with me is the president of the united states bill clinton. and i'd like to welcome you to the area and to kdka. the president: thank you, mike. glad to be here. q there are a lot of things we'd like to talk about in the brief amount of time we have, but some news is just breaking from los angeles. i guess the entire country has been kind of holding their breath, wondering what's going to happen in the trial of the four los angeles police officers. we just heard that two of those officers, the sergeant, sergeant koon and officer powell have been found guilty, and two officers have been found not guilty. it's a situation that's been building for over a year since the first trial and now this trial and this verdict. and i wonder what your thoughts are this morning on how you see the situation in los angeles in connection with your administration and what you're trying to do. the president: well, first of all, i think the american people should know that this trial, in my judgment, is a tribute to the work and judgment of the jury, as well as to the efforts of the federal government in developing the case. the law under which the officers were tried is a complex one; the standards of proof are complicated. the jury decided that they would convict the sergeant who was responsible for supervising the officers and the officer who on the film did most of the beating. the jury acquitted an officer who kicked rodney king, but also plainly tried to shield him from some blows, and another officer who was a rookie. no one knows exactly why they did what they did, but it appears that they really tried to do justice here. they acknowledged that his civil rights were violated. and i think that the american people should take a lot of pride in that. but i hope now we can begin to look ahead and focus on three things: first of all, the importance of trying to bring this country together and not violate the civil rights of any american; secondly, the importance of renewing our fight against crime. i think it's important to recognize that in the poorest areas of los angeles and many other cities in this country, people may be worried about police abuse, but they're even more worried about crime. it's time that we renewed our efforts to go to community policing -- put 100,000 more police officers on the street; pass the brady bill that would require a waiting period before people could buy a handgun, and do some other things to reduce the vulnerability of our people to violence and drugs. and the last point i'd like to make is it seems to me that we have got to rededicate ourselves to the economic revitalization of our cities and other economically-distressed areas. if you just think about it -- if everybody in los angeles who wanted a job had one, i don't think we'd have quite as many problems as we do. and i laid out a very ambitious program in the campaign to try to bring private investment and public investment to bear in our cities. i have dispatched the commerce secretary, ron brown, to california to try to come up with some strategies for that state, because it's our biggest state with our highest unemployment rate -- which could then be applied around the country. i want to talk to him and to the attorney general, to the new head of the naacp, to reverend jackson, and to several other people, and then i'll decide where to go from here with regard to los angeles and the other cities of the country. q let's talk about what brings you to the pittsburgh area today. there have been -- i guess there's been a lot of discussion on capitol hill about your stimulus package. you've been locked in a battle with the gop. yesterday, as you said earlier in your radio address, you made some moves to break that gridlock. what brings you to pittsburgh, in particular to allegheny county, in particular to pennsylvania, with that battle? the president: well, there are two reasons. first of all, pittsburgh, allegheny county and pennsylvania supported me in the last election because they wanted a new direction in economic policy. we have passed our overall economic plan; it gives the country a very different budget for the next five years than we've had in the previous 12. we reduced the deficit and, at the same time, increased investment in jobs and education and health care, in the things that will make us a stronger country. but in addition to that, i asked the congress in the short run to spend a little more money, a modest amount of money to create another half-million jobs in the next year and a half; to try to cut the unemployment rate by a half a percent; but also to try to spark job creation in the private sector more. the plan passed the house. it has the support of a majority of the senate. at the present time, all the republican senators as a bloc are filibustering the bill. that is, they won't let it come to a vote. i believe that senator specter would like to vote for the bill. and i believe that senator dole, the republican leader, has put a lot of pressure on a lot of the republicans to stay hitched. and they're all saying that this bill increases the deficit. it doesn't. this bill is well below the spending targets that congress approved, including the republicans, for this year. this bill is paid for by budget cuts in the next five years. this bill is designed to give a jump-start to the economy. and i must say, a lot of the republican senators that are holding it up, when mr. bush was president, voted for billions of dollars of emergency spending of just this kind -- much of it was totally unrelated to creating jobs. so what i'm trying to do is to break this logjam. i've held out an olive branch, i've offered a compromise. but i think that we ought to try to put some more americans to work right now to show that we're changing the direction of the country. and that's the purpose of the bill. q have you been in touch with senator specter or his office lately? the president: well, we've been trying to talk regularly to -- through my white house congressional liaison operation to the senators that we think are open to this -- senator specter, senator d'amato from new york, senator jeffords from vermont, senator hatfield from oregon, and five or six others whom we believe know we need more jobs in this economy and know that we are paying for this with budget cuts over the life of the budget i presented. you know, it has a lot of appeal to say, well, we've got a big deficit, we shouldn't increase it more. but the truth is that we are paying for this with budget cuts in the whole life of the budget over the next few years. and more importantly, we have this program well below the spending targets that congress has already approved for this year. and they've done this for years, with the republicans voting for it -- many republicans voting for it -- for things that weren't nearly as important as putting the american people back to work. so i just hope that this doesn't become a political issue. it ought to just be about the people of this country and the need for jobs. q i have some questions from people who supported you, and some people who are skeptical about your administration. it has to do with their hopes, and also with their fears. a lot of people who supported you and voted for you in pennsylvania --i think some of them are now saying, we're glad we got him in the white house, but now look at this incredible process he has to go through. look at these problems. look at this gridlock. and they're beginning to wonder, is this going to work; can you pull it off? and, of course, your skeptics are saying, well, i knew it was going to be like this. the president: well, what i would -- i'd ask people, first of all, to remember that we are, frankly, moving very fast. the budget resolution that the congress passed is the fastest they have ever passed a budget resolution -- ever -- in history, setting out the next five-year budget targets. so we are moving really rapidly. and we've got them working on political reform, welfare reform, health care reform, a whole wide range of things. but it's a big operation. you can't expect to turn it around overnight. it took 12 years to produce the conditions which led to the victory i received from the people in november, and we can't turn it around in 90 days. but i think we're making real, real progress. i would urge the people not to get discouraged. we're not going to win every battle, and not everything is going to happen overnight. but we are definitely moving and changing things. q thank you very much. the president of the united states, bill clinton, here live at pittsburgh international airport. i'm mike whitely, kdka news.",
            "don't expect to get top quality, just some toughness. i don't view makarov as a player who would add toughness. nelson, you're confusing skill and toughness. hey, get off the mcgill/hammond thing. i'm no fan of either. my point is that last year the sharks had toughness that was missing this year. this year we had more skill, i'm all for that, but if your skill players keep getting beat up and injured they can't do you much good. whether it's a cheap shot or not you can't let the other teams push you around. the 1992-93 sharks simply got pushed around to much. other teams knew this. they knew they could aggressively check the sharks and not pay for it. adding some players in the off season who will add some toughness to the team will help insure that next season other teams will be more hesistant to vigorously check our skill players, or to take cheap shots. it doesn't guarantee no injuries (nothing does), but it's something the sharks can do to reduce the number of injuries. mark just say",

            "perhaps one way of getting away from this cripple chip that the u.s. government seems to be pushing would be to come up with a good alternative. for example, how about a scheme using rsa, and some hybrid of des-cfb and another strong stream cipher (maybe idea-cfb)? this could be substantially the same as the cripple chip, except that instead of key-registration, the police could demand that you give up your secret key to them (with a court- issued warrant). then, they could read the last few months of wiretapped messages you've sent, and assuming you've committed no crimes, you could generate a new key pair and go about your business. i find that i'd be willing to pay rsa for the right to use such a system, especially given the alternative. if you were unwilling to give up your secret key, then you'd probably stay in jail (has anyone got a real legal precedent for this?). this would allow court-issued warrants to be used to gather information on suspected criminals, but it couldn't be done in secrecy, and there would be enormously less likelihood of corruption or theft of escrowed keys.

            "the following is an introduction as to who is muhammad saw as will be covered with this treatise. muhammad peace and blessings of allah be upon him (saw) is the last prophet of islam. he is the prophet who is revealed the last holy scripture, qur'an, by allah swa (all praise be to him) through the arch angel gabriel. he is the seal of all prophets till the day of judgement as stated in the qur'an by allah swa (all praise be to him). muhammad saw lived between 571-632 ac. all other prophethoods claimed after muhammad saw, is a treason against islam, against qur'an, against the message of allah swa. muhammad saw is from the seed of ishmael, another messenger of allah and son of abraham also a messenger of allah. he is the messenger that previous holy scriptures foretold his coming. the above mentioned verse from the qur'an is from chapter 33, verse 40 whose rough translation is as follows: muhammad is not the father of any of your men, but (he is) the messenger of allah, and the seal of the prophets, and allah has full knowledge of all things. --------------------- commentary on the above verse: when a document is sealed, it is complete, and there can be no further addition. the holy prophet muhammad saw closed the long line of messengers. allah's teaching is and will always be continuous, but there has been and will be no prophet after muhammad saw. the later ages will want thinkers, and revivers, not prophets. this is not an arbitrary matter. it is a decree full of knowledge and wisdom, \"for allah has full knowledge of all things.\" ---------------------- droplet vol 1, no 11, part 2 a d r o p l e t from the vast ocean of the miraculous qur'an translations from the arabic and turkish writings of bediuzzaman said nursi, the risale-i noor vol 1, no 11, part 2 ------------------------------------------------------------------ nineteenth letter mu'jizat-i ahmediye risalesi (a treatise on the miracles of muhammed saw) (continued from droplet vol 1, no 11, part 1) second sign: the noble messenger (saw) declared his prophethood, and presented to humanity a decree as the glorious qur'an and manifest miracles which number, according to the scholars, one thousand. the occurrence of those miracles in their entirety is as certain as the fact that he declared himself prophet. in fact, as a shown by the words of the most obstinate unbelievers quoted in various places of the wise our'an, even they could not deny the occurrence of his miracles, but only called them -hasha wa kella!-(allah forbids) sorcery, in order to satisfy themselves, or to deceive their followers. the miracles of muhammad (saw) have the certainty of confirmation by consensus of ulema (scholars of islam) to the hundreth degree. the miracle is the conformation by the creator of the universe of his declaration of prophethood; it has the effect of the words,'you have indeed spoken the truth !' suppose that you said in the assembly of a ruler, while being observed by him, 'the true ruler has appointed me to such and such position. 'at a time when you were asked to prove your claim, the word 'yes' uttered by the ruler would sufficiently support you. or, if the ruler changed his usual practice and attitude at your request, this would confirm your claim even more soundly and more definitely than would the word 'yes.' in the same way, allah's most noble messenger claimed: 'i am the envoy of the creator of this universe. my proof is that he will change his unbroken order at my request and my prayer. now look at my fingers: he makes them run like a fountain with five spigots. look at the moon: by a gesture of my finger, he splits it in two. look at that tree: to affirm me, and to bear witness to me, it moves and comes near to me. look at this food: although it is barely enough for two or three men, it satisfies two or three hundred. 'further he shows hundreds of similar miracles. however, the evidences of the veracity of this high being and the proofs of his prophethood are not restricted to his miracles. all his deeds and acts, his words and behavior, his moral conduct and manners, his character and appearance prove to the attentive his truthfulness and seriousness. indeed, many people such as abdullah b. salam, the famous scholar of the children of israel, came to belief merely by seeing him, and said, 'no lie can hide in this face, nor can any fraud be found in it!' although many of the researchers have concluded that the proofs of the prophethood of muhammad and his miracles number about one thousand, there are thousands, perhaps hundreds of thousands of proofs of his prophethood. and hundreds of thousands of truth-seeking men (muhakkikiin) with varying opinions have affirmed his prophethood in an equal number of ways. the wise our'an alone demonstrates thousands of the proofs of his prophethood, in addition to its own forty aspects of miraculousness. since prophethood is as a phenomenon of humanity, and hundreds of thousands of individuals who claimed prophethood and performed miracles have lived and passed away; then, the prophethood of muhammad (saw) is of a certanity superior to that of the prophethood of all the others. for whatever evidences, qualities and attributes became the means of the prophethood and messengership of all the messengers such as jesus (as) and moses (as), they are all owned in a more perfect and comprehensive fashion by muhammad (saw). and since the causes and means of prophetic authority exist more perfectly in the person of muhammad (saw), this authority is to be found in him with more certanity than all the other prophets.",

            "another f2 rider had similiar problems, and this is the mail i sent him, hope this helps resolve you problem! at good point, did not catch this in the original post. the only other things which come to mind, since this is a gravity feed fuel system, is this. the fuel petcock valve is vacuum controlled from the #1 carburator. let suppose there is a small hole or bad seal either in the hose itself or the vacuum valve in the fuel petcock. when it is cold, the hole is open enough to open the valve just enough to allow gas to the carbs with the choke on, since the choke creates more low pressure in the carbs when on to draw gas, and as the engine and surrounding area warm up, the hole seals up. one way to check fuel flow through the valve would be to pull the side panels off and remove the fuel hose to the carbs. connect a tube of the correct size, preferably clear tubing to observe fuel flow, on the output side of the fuel petcock. remove the control hose from #1 carburator. make sure the tank is full. place the valve in the on position and apply vacuum to the control hose, preferably with a vacuum device with a gauge, to check for air leaks. with vacuum applied, fuel should flow freely. to see if there is a vent problem, do this with the fuel filler cap open and closed, if it flows a lot faster with the filler cap open, then there may be something in the vent airway which changes position and depending on the position may clog or partially clog the vent. i have heard of some f2 fuel tanks being replaced to fix this problem. so the things which might be defective are, the control hose from #1 carb, the petcock valve, and possibly the fuel tank vent. now if all of the above shows no problem of fuel flow when cold, then there is something in the carbs screwed up, but there are so many things to check, i would be typing all day to list them all! here are a few, with everything back together, apply vacuum to the petcock valve and open the drain holes on the carbs one by one to check fuel flow. open up the airbox and check for foreign debris or clogged airways on the carbs, there are quite a few on each carb. i hope something is flushed out with all this trouble shooting. if american honda does not resolve this, get mad as hell and report them to the bbb and call the honda customer service hotline. it is a 800 number, but i don't recall it off the top of my head. i called just about tires for my f2 and a few days later a customer satisfaction inquiry card arrived at home asking how i liked the support i received, here would be your chance to tell them what you think!",

            "i wouldn't give baserunning that much value. the above effect is clear, but there are other effects as well. if olerud hits a double, any runner on first will score; if alomar legs an extra base onto a hit in the gap, the runner on first may need to hold at third. thus olerud's doubles have more advancement value than alomar's. (of course, alomar is more likely to score after hitting a double.) another reason not to give too much extra value to baserunning is that the runs created formulas work for very fast and very slow teams. no team in the 1950's ran much, but some teams certainly had faster players than others. still, the current runs created formulas work just as well in the 1950's for all teams. bill james gives the 1955-1958 senators as an example. they used harmon killebrew regularly as a pinch runner, and in 1957, stole 13 bases with 38 times caught stealing. yet they scored slightly more runs than predicted by runs created.",

            "marhaba nabil, if we posit two minds in christ, the mind of the logos and the mind of the human jesus, then we must admit two wills. a mind is not a mind without a will. i know this has been dealt with in past church prnouncements, but there is a philosophical problem here that should examined. t. v. morris argued that the incarnation can be seen like this: _____________ (mind of logos) ( _______ ) ( ( ) ) here, the mind of jesus is circumsribed by god the ( ( human ) ) son. god the son has complete access to the human ( ( mind ) ) mind but the human mind only has access to the mind ( ( ) ) of god the son when the son allows access. this ( (_______) ) explains why jesus said even he did not know the (_____________) time of the kingdom. the human will acted in accordance with the divine will according to free human decision. but if the human will would have decided differently than what was intended the divine will would have interceded, but this was never the case. he employs some very interesting analogies to support the one person/two mind theory. the ideas of a completely healthy version of split personality from the field of psychology, and the intriguing ideas of being in a dream, seeing yourself acting, knowing that is you, but also being omniscient. the one hypostasis would be the unity of the two minds. agreed. but i am still waiting for morris and others to respond to the lingering problem of two minds making two persons. christian analytic philosophers are breaking new ground in explicating the rationality of theism and the incarnation. ==================================== ted kalivoda (tedr@athena.cs.uga.edu) university of georgia, athens institute of higher ed.",

(if you do not open your mouth, then you don't put you foot into your mouth either). but then if you say quran does not talk much about science, then one can not make claims (like bobby does) that you have great science in quran. basically i want to say that *none* of the religious texts are supposed to be scientific treatises. so i am just requesting the theists to stop making such wild claims. --- vinayak ------------------------------------------------------- vinayak dutt e-mail: vdp@mayo.edu standard disclaimers apply",

            "you've asked a toughie of a question. there are many different drugs which are used for chemotherapy. the overall purpose of chemotherapy (don't worry about the spelling. some of these crazy medical words are impossible to spell! :-) is to either destroy cancer cells or to keep them from growing. different drugs have different effects on cancer cells, and therefore, it is not uncommon to use more than one drug at a time. some chemotherapeutic drugs are effective anytime during the growth cycle of a cell. others work only at specific times during the cell cycle. the first phase of the cell cycle is g1; it is when the protein synthesis and rna systhesis occurs. in the second phase, s, synthesis of dna occurs. the third phase is g2; the dna splits and rna and protein are synthesized aagain. in the fourth phase, m (or mitosis), the cell may divide. there are drugs which are effective in each phase. some stop dna synthesis. others stop the cell from dividing. others wreck protein synthesis. at any rate, the end result that is being sought is for the cancer cells to stop growing. if what you are seeking is \"practical\" advice, i apologize for rambling on the techno stuff. some side effects are pretty common. chemo. drugs are rather nasty. it can cause a person to lose their appetite and to experience nausea and vomiting. things to help this include eating small frequent meals. it is also suggested that if nausea/vomiting (hereafter known as n/v) occurs that the person notify the doctor; there are medicines tthat help nausea. diarrhea can be an effect. antidiarrheal medications can be given, and good skincare and fluid intake are important. probably the one of biggest concsern is hair loss. this does not always happen. it depends on what drugs are being given, and on the person themself. different people taking the same drug can and do have different side effects. i have seen some literature which states that wearing a snug headband and/or wearing an ice cap can help reduce hair loss, presumably by reducing blood flow to the scalp. if anyone has seen research on this too, i would love to see it, and possibly some bib data. i highly recommend making contact with the american cancer society. they have a vast selection of literature and information. in addition, if your friend has had a mastectomy, i highly recommend \"reach for recovery\". it is a support group comprised entirely of women who have lost a breast because of cancer. they can offer some excellent support and suggestions. if you have further questions, please send me e-mail. i hav some good access to information, and i enjoy trying to help other people.",

            "the hamas way of death (following is a transcript of a recruitment and training videotape made last summer by the qassam battalions, the military arm of hamas, an islamic palestinian group. hamas figures significantly in the middle east equation. in december, israel deported more than 400 palestinians to lebanon in response to hamas's kidnapping and execution of an israeli soldier. a longer version appears in the may issue of harper's magazine, which obtained and translated the tape.) my name is yasir hammad al-hassan ali. i live in nuseirat [a refugee camp in the gaza strip]. i was born in 1964. i finished high school, then attended gaza polytechnic. later, i went to work for islamic university in gaza as a clerk. i'm married and i have two daughters. the qassam battalions are the only group in palestine explicitly dedicated to jihad [holy war]. our primary concern is palestinians who collaborate with the enemy. many young men and women have fallen prey to the cunning traps laid by the [israeli] security services. since our enemies are trying to obliterate our nation, cooperation with them is clearly a terrible crime. our most important objective must be to put an end to the plague of collaboration. to do so, we abduct collaborators, intimidate and interrogate them in order to uncover other collaborators and expose the methods that the enemy uses to lure palestinians into collaboration in the first place. in addition to that, naturally, we confront the problem of collaborators by executing them. we don't execute every collaborator. after all, about 70 percent of them are innocent victims, tricked or black-mailed into their misdeeds. the decision whether to execute a collaborator is based on the seriousness of his crimes. if, like many collaborators, he has been recruited as an agent of the israeli border guard then it is imperative that he be executed at once. he's as dangerous as an israeli soldier, so we treat him like an israeli soldier. there's another group of collaborators who perform an even more loathsome role -- the ones who help the enemy trap young men and women in blackmail schemes that force them to become collaborators. i regard the \"isqat\" [the process by which a palestinians is blackmailed into collaboration] of single person as greater crime than the killing of a demonstrator. if someone is guilty of causing repeated cases of isqat, than it is our religious duty to execute him. a third group of collaborators is responsible for the distribution of narcotics. they work on direct orders from the security services to distribute drugs as widely as possible. their victims become addicted and soon find it unbearable to quit and impossible to afford more. they collaborate in order to get the drugs they crave. the dealers must also be executed. in the battalions, we have developed a very careful method of uncovering collaborators, we can't afford to abduct an innocent person, because once we seize a person his reputation is tarnished forever. we will abduct and interrogate a collaborator only after evidence of his guilt has been established -- never before. if after interrogation the collaborator is found guilty beyond any doubt, then he is executed. in many cases, we don't have to make our evidence against collaborators public, because everyone knows that they're guilty. but when the public isn't aware that a certain individual is a collaborator, and we accuse him, people are bound to ask for evidence. many people will proclaim his innocence, so there must be irrefutable proof before he is executed. this proof is usually obtained in the form of a confession. at first, every collaborator denies his crimes. so we start off by showing the collaborator the testimony against him. we tell him that he still has a chance to serve his people, even in the last moment of his life, by confessing and giving us the information we need. we say that we know his repentance in sincere and that he has been a victim. that kind of talk is convincing. most of them confess after that. others hold out; in those cases, we apply pressure, both psychological and physical. then the holdouts confess as well. only one collaborator has ever been executed without an interrogation. in that case, the collaborator had been seen working for the border guard since before the intifada, and he himself confessed his involvement to a friend, who disclosed the information to us. in addition, three members of his network of collaborators told us that he had caused their isqat. with this much evidence, there was no need to interrogate him. but we are very careful to avoid wrongful executions. in every case, our principal is the same: the accused should be interrogated until he himself confesses his crimes. a few weeks ago, we sat down and complied a list of collaborators to decide whether there were any who could be executed without interrogation. an although we had hundreds of names, still, because of our fear of god and of hell, we could not mark any of these men, except for the one i just mentioned, for execution. when we execute a collaborator in public, we use a gun. but after we abduct and interrogate a collaborator, we can't shoot him -- to do so might give away our locations. that's why collaborators are strangled. sometimes we ask the collaborator, \"what do you think? how should we execute you?\" one collaborator told us, \"strangle me.\" he hated the sight of blood.",

            "two developments have brought these type of activities back to the forefront in 1993. first, in february, the russians deployed a 20-m reflector from a progress vehicle after it had departed from the mir space station. while this \"banner\" reflector was blank, npo energia was very active in reporting that future banner reflectors will be available to advertisers, who could use a space- based video of their logo or ad printed on the banner in a tv commercial, as filmed from the mir. the second development, has been that space marketing inc, the same company responsible for merchandising space on the conestoga booster and comet spacecraft, is now pushing the \"environmental billboard\". as laid out by smi chief engineer dr ron humble of the university of colorado space laboratory and preston carter of the lawrence livermore national laboratory, the \"environmental billboard\" is a large inflatable outer support structure of up to 804x1609 meters. advertising is carried by a mylar reflective area, deployed by the inflatable 'frame'. to help sell the concept, the spacecraft responsible for maintaining the billboard on orbit will carry \"ozone reading sensors\" to \"continuously monitor the condition of the earth's delicate protective ozone layer,\" according to mike lawson, head of smi. furthermore, the inflatable billboard has reached its minimum exposure of 30 days it will be released to re-enter the earth's atmosphere. according to imi, \"as the biodegradable material burns, it will release ozone-building components that will literally replenish the ozone layer.\" the remaining spacecraft will monitor the atmosphere for another year before it, too, re-enters and burns up and \"adds to the ozone supply.\" this would not be a cheap advertisement, costing at least several millions of dollars (exact costs were not available). but smi estimates that market exposure would be 3-5x that of the people who watched the superbowl, where a 30-second advertising 'unit' cost $600,000. since smi is located in atlanta, georgia, it is being promoted as being available in time for the opening of the 1996 summer olympics in atlanta. but back to brian's questions: see above. as for serious -- if they can get $15-20 m or so (my estimate of $5-10 for development costs and a flight unit, plus $10-15 m for a launch), then it's probably real. they are claiming to tailor the orbit to overfly specific locations at specific times for optimum advertising impact so they probably can't piggy back upon someone else's planned launch and will have to buy a dedicated launch. that's a $10-15 m cost they need to raise, right there. and there will probably be some legal challenges to this as well. note there is one potential legal challenge to smi on the use of launch vehicle advertising already. while i don't think the legal challenges would win out (and yes, i am an amateur astronomer, and no, i don't really like the idea of this additional light pollution, but i know of no prohibition of it...), the legal challenges and court fights would probably remove any positive aspects of the advertising. i can imagine several ways to make the advertisers look like louts for doing this -- which would change positive market exposure to negative market exposure, and negate the space advertising advantage. (would you spend $15 m to look like an idiot?) (and light pollution might not be too bad -- if it's in a low enough orbit, and it relies upon reflected light only, it would only be visible for a short time just after local dusk and before dawn. for maximum market exposure, you want to have it visible just after dusk --minimizing impact on astronomy, since that's the time of worse seeing due to day/night thermal turbulence. it might still be a problem, but perhaps there are ways to mitigate this...) as for having real funding -- none that i can identify. there were about 60 expressions of interest made on the conestoga advertising opportunity, but that included curious folks and was for only a $500,000 commitment. i haven't heard of any serious funding for this, but i'm sure they are shopping the venture around looking for some money in order to flesh out the concept some more. but i am confident there are no firm or paying customers at this time. and if anybody wants to cross-post this to sci.astro, please be my guest. i don't have posting privileges to that area (or at least i don't think i do...). ------------------------------------------------------------------- wales larrison space technology investor",

            "ever since craig rowland posted his piece \"new encryption\" to sci.crypt there has been some discussion of our company, secured communications technologies, inc, and on encryption algorithm, nea. i spoke to craig at length on 4/21/93 and we covered a lot of ground. some of the information in the posting requires some clarification, and i would like to answer some of the questions raised on sci.crypt. sct is a small company based in silver spring maryland. our two main products at this time are a pc based secure communications program called secom and a general purpose encryption chip which uses the nea algorithm developed for secom. secom provides an encrypted secure communication link between two pc's connected over dial up telephone lines. it supports simultaneous bi-directional file transfer and keyboard to screen \"chat\". it has its own proprietary communications protocol which is tightly integrated to the encryption. all though it is a packetized link, the data stream appears to be continuous because the packet boundaries are hidden. when secom was initially developed, it was implemented to use des encryption. a business decision was made to seek export approval for the product because it was perceived that the overseas market was a large one and provided a good marketing opportunity. we soon found out that we would never be granted general export approval for anything using des. all though the reason for this was never explicitly stated, it seems to have something to do with secret government to government agreements which are still in effect. in any event, the decision was made to develop a new and different algorithm which would take the place of des. this was the reason nea (new encryption algorithm) was born. at this time nea is being held as a trade secret. the preliminary work of patenting it has begun, and the plan is to make it public once the patent process is complete. all though one can make certain legal arguments for keeping it an ongoing secret, i think in the case of an encryption algorithm it is necessary to let people \"shoot at it\" over an extended period of time to prove its worth. in order to get export approval for secom/nea, it was necessary to go through nsa and to reveal to them the details of the program and algorithm. this was done only after we had a finished product to submit. let me state unequivocally that there is no \"back door\" to the program or the algorithm. secured communications technologies is a closely held private company and nsa/fbi/cia/nist/whatever has no financial interest in any way whatsoever with the company or any of the people involved. from a practical business standpoint, we are interested in selling chips and software (hopefully in large quantities) and a back door to the encryption, if found out, could destroy our credibility and our business. with the encryption algorithm approved for export, we set out to talk to a number of potential customers for encryption products and systems. we were able to identify several common threads of functionality requirements. this led to the design of a chip with the encryption algorithm \"cast in silicon\" and certain other capabilities added so that the chip could fulfill the broad range of requirements that we identified. we are strongly opposed to the clipper/capstone chips. in a press release today, our president, dr. stephen bryen stated: \"it seems as if the government has an unlimited source of funds to use to push its new bugged chips on the american public. but do we not understand how the national security agency, which is not supposed to be involved in domestic spying, can fund the development of a commercial chip intended to accommodate u.s. government domestic spying activities.\"",

            "no. the issue is reducing crime, not guns. if gun control doesn't lower crime overall, then is doesn't address the issue. does that matter if assaults with a baseball bat become much more common? muggers using a gun rely primarily on the threat of the gun, and rarely shoot their victim. a mugger using a knife is much more likely to start by stabbing his victim in an effort incapacitate him. so, while a knif may not be as deadly as a gun, criminals are more likely to actually _use_ the knife (as opposed to threatening the victim with it.) it isn't at all clear that replacing the criminal's gun with a knife would reduce murders. stabbings might just become more common. that's why it is important to look at the overall (not the with-gun) homicide rate. it avoids the issue of substitution, different criminal techinques of using different weapons, etc... and measures what we want to prevent: murders. \"face\"? possibly. however, facing knife-welding attackers isn't too common: stabbing without warning and by supprise is the usual tactic. very few criminals shoot from cover: it attracts to much attention and they don't have a chance to go through your pockets. overall, i'd much rather be threatened with a gun than actually stabbed with a knife. actually, the exact same statement is true of guns: training in unarmed self-defence will let you disarm an untrained gunman without much problem. you also ignore the criminal's reaction: the national crime survey clearly shows that criminals (unarmed, armed with a knife, gun or whatever) are unwilling to risk their lives in a confrontation. if faced with a serious threat, almost all prefer to leave and find an easier target. therefore, using (or threatening to use, as is much more commonly the case) a weapon _is_ the best defence against an attacker, regardless of how he is armed. knives, however, are much less effective than guns: criminals don't consider knifes as a \"serious threat\" nearly as often as they do guns.",

            "to those who are wondering what is happening in minnesota: from what i have seen in the local news (tv and newspaper), various people in the area are trying to get a new hockey team. a columnist for the st. paul \"pioneer press\" wrote an article giving the \"inside scoop\" on the issue. there are three local sites competing for a team and three possible candiates to move to the twin cities. first the sites: target center, civic center (st. paul), and yes, even the met center. the columnist was pretty confident that minnesota will get a team, and that the target center will ultimately win out. he argued, however, that the competition from the other two sites will delay the process considerably. without the inter-site competition, the columnist (sorry, i can't remember his name) believes that minnesota would have a team by the 1994-95 season. also, because of the situation with the timberwolves, things will be delayed until (unless) the city of minneapolis takes over the target center. however, they are unlikely to do so until the met center is destroyed, because the city will lose money if there is competition from the met for conventions and short-term events (even with hockey at target). to add to this mess, a study (6 to 12 months) is going to be conducted on the future viability of the met center, which obviously delays the process even further. i hope that the study is cancelled, which will have the effect of knocking the met center out of the running and perhaps encouraging minneapolis to take over the target center sooner. the city would be be even more encourged if the wrecking ball is taken to the met, which may happen. regarding possible candidates, the three teams are hartford, tampa bay, and new jersey. i would prefer the devils (minnesota \" ice demons?\") although the lightning may have potential. although it hasn't been announced yet, it looks like 6 neutral site games will be played at the target center next year. apparently the devils are interested in playing in as many of those six games as possible, and i wouldn't be surprised to see hartford and tampa show up there either. so, minnesota may end up getting another team, but it may take a few years. go sabres!",

            "saying \"hopefully the effect of policy x will be y\" is *much* different from saying \"hopefully if there is any effect of policy x it will be y.\" here you've made both statements. if the former describes a reasonably-likely outcome of policy x, then perhaps policy x is worthy of consideration - but the latter statement is not something to base policy decisions on! according to groups like the center to prevent handgun violence (formerly the national coalition to ban handguns - interesting name change, don't you think?) who include murder and suicide by firearms in the \"leading causes of unintentional death) figures but *don't* include murder and suicide by other means as causes of unintentional death. can't you see past the bullshit? certainly accidental deaths by any cause are serious things - but the anti-gun groups insist over and over again that accidental death by firearms is a *stastically serious problem*, and even if you don't use these deaths as a justification for gun control, these groups do. i'm sorry if i jumped to conclusions about your reason for mentioning accidental deaths due to firearms being something that warranted concern, but in light of your statement that you are a staunch supporter of gun control measures, i think the conclusion was a reasonable one. the fact remains that tragic though individual accidental gun deaths may be, they are *not* a serious problem statistically speaking. sorry if it wasn't clear to me. i thought you were waffling on your view of buyback programs with the talk of symbolic offerings and hopefully preventing accidents and heat-of-passion shootings. i have to disagree on all these counts; i can't understand how a buying guns from people who aren't intending to misuse them (obviously those who want to use guns to commit crimes aren't going to turn them in) could be construed as a positive way for police to respond to \"interpersonal violence.\" what, the people who publish figures saying that as many children commit suicide by handguns alone each year as the fbi says commit suicide by all methods per year? who do you think i should believe? the people who call everyone up to age 24 \"children\" when they're screaming about the \"carnage of our nation's children\" being caused by handguns? ah, yes, the agency that considers accidental shootings of children to be such a statistical problem that a stated objective in the healthy people 2000 document is to \"enact laws in 50 states requiring manufacturers of handguns to make the handguns more difficult to fire, minimizing the likelihood of accidental or intentional dscharge by children?\" the agency that funded the \"study\" of dc which pronounced that the dc gun ban had saved x lives (yes, they actually gave us a number) on the basis of a look at the *number* of shootings rather than the *rate* of shootings? it wasn't their fault that the population of dc dropped in their \"post law\" period... okay, i'll concede i no longer have the numbers i once read on these. i'll retract my dispute of your numbers. however, i would be greatly interested in seeing how cphv and cdc came up with these numbers. what's this got to do with anything? hell, when *i* was in elementary school i came home to an empty house with guns in it. why is this a problem? i didn't touch the guns - i had been taught not to. i had also been taught not to mess with the gasoline in the garage, the fuse box, the car, the knives, the oven, and the tools. the problem is not the guns, it's the parents!!! and what are these states doing with the kids they find with guns? nothing. no criminal prosecution, no expulsion, in most cases not even suspension. they take the gun, slap the kids on the wrist, say \"ain't it awful,\" and go on as if everything's back to normal. what's wrong with this picture? i don't think koresh was the messiah, either... but isn't it obvious that if he believed the forces of evil were come to destroy him, then he believed the children were much safer inside the compound? i didn't say he was sane... just that he behaved in a pretty rational manner given what he thought was going on. he thought he had them in the one place where harm *wouldn't* come to them. let's see *you* try to find the exits, unbarricade them, and flee a fire when you've been kept awake for most of 50 days by loudspeakers and subjected to six hours of tanks knocking in your walls and tear gas assault.",

            "i have an idea as to why the encryption algorithm needs to be keep secret, and some things that i think it implies. (of course these could all be wrong.....) from the clipper chip: a technical summary dorothy denning revised, april 21, 1993 . . . the clipper chip contains a classified single-key 64-bit block encryption algorithm called \"skipjack.\" the algorithm uses 80 bit keys (compared with 56 for the des) and has 32 rounds of scrambling (compared with 16 for the des). it supports all 4 des modes of operation. the algorithm takes 32 clock ticks, and in electronic codebook (ecb) mode runs at 12 mbits per second. each chip includes the following components: the skipjack encryption algorithm f, an 80-bit family key that is common to all chips n, a 30-bit serial number (this length is subject to change) u, an 80-bit secret key that unlocks all messages encrypted with the chip . . . encrypting with the chip to see how the chip is used, imagine that it is embedded in the at&t telephone security device (as it will be). suppose i call someone and we both have such a device. after pushing a button to start a secure conversation, my security device will negotiate an 80-bit session key k with the device at the other end. this key negotiation takes place without the clipper chip. in general, any method of key exchange can be used such as the diffie-hellman public-key distribution method. once the session key k is established, the clipper chip is used to encrypt the conversation or message stream m (digitized voice). the telephone security device feeds k and m into the chip to produce two values: e[m; k], the encrypted message stream, and e[e[k; u] + n; f], a law enforcement field , which are transmitted over the telephone line. the law enforcement field thus contains the session key k encrypted under the unit key u concatenated with the serial number n, all encrypted under the family key f. the law enforcement field is decrypted by law enforcement after an authorized wiretap has been installed. ------------------ suppose i knew how the algorithm worked and knew the n for my chip, but did not know f, then by cryptanalysis i might be able to determine f from if law enforcement field e[e[k; u] + n; f] not knowing n would might make this much harder. now suppose that i know f, (either legitimately or not), if i know k (either because i am involved in the conversation, or i know u for a party in the conversation), i may now be able to determine u for the other party. if i know f i can also defeat the law enforcement field, since i could make my own, with a different k then the one i am using. knowing f also allows traffic analysis to be performed. so i might not know what you are saying but i could know who you are saying it too. now i admit that someone trying to compute u will not have lots of messages to work from, but since we have no way of knowing that the key generation method does not (deliberately?) generate weak keys, or for that matter that the published method is in fact used, perhaps the u's will be chosen from know weak keys for the system. obviously the compromise of f would be a disaster, both to law enforcement for whom this whole thing is designed, and for the people who believe that it is giving them security. f is but one number, and i sure that alot of people (more then 1) know what it is (and if some \"panel of experts\" is going to check it over for flaws then many more will know f, forget grinding chips, bribery and blackmail work just fine. so, am i wrong? or are these problems.",

name of jesus,' and save his flock from ottoman rule. source: \"the 'past' in medieval and modern greek culture,\" in speros vryonis, ed., 'byzantina kai metabyzantina,' vol i (malibu, calif., 1978).

mustafa kemal, and on august 30, 1922 they annihilated the bulk of the greek army. now wait, there is more. <<the greek war of independence brought disaster to the jewish communities in the peloponnesos, where the revolution erupted in 1821. the jews, because of their close association with the ottoman administration, were massacred along with the turks. the jewish communities of mistras, tripolis, and kalamata were decimated; the few survivors moved north to settle in chalkis and volos, still under ottoman rule. patras lost its ancient jewish community, which was refounded only in 1905.>> nikos stavroulakis 'athens-auschwitz', page ix. source: professor stanford j. shaw, 'the jews of the ottoman empire and the turkish republic,' new york university press, new york (1991). page 187: <<...the disintegration of the ottoman empire which had been going on for a century was disastrous for ottoman jewry. this was the age of nationalism among the christian subjects of the sultan, starting with the greek revolution early in the nineteenth century, which, based on the megali idea, or great idea, sought to add to greek kingdom istanbul and large portions of anatolia, union of which with greece was felt to be the 'dream and hope of all'. the success of the greek national movement, provided more in fact by the intervention of the great powers than by the efforts of the greeks themselves, stimulated similar uprisings among the other subjects in southeastern europe who had long been oppressed, not so much by the ottomans but, rather, by the greek religious hierarchy which dominated the orthodox millet, leading first to pressure for religious independence, granted to the bulgarian orthodox exarchate in 1870, to the serbian church in 1879, and to the rumanian church in 1885, with subsequent aspirations for, and achievement of, political independence following...>> page 188: <<...they [new nationalist leaders] were greatly assisted in their campaigns against the ottomans both by the diplomatic and consular representatives of the major powers of europe and also by christian missionaries, who emphasized feelings of christian superiority and hatred for muslims and jews which fortified the religious as well as ethnic bases of their pursuit of independence. christian nationalism, based as much on religious as on ethnic identity, soon resurrected the medieval bigotries which had devastated both jews and muslims and consequently had driven them together in the past. vicious anti-muslim and anti-semitic movements developed, involving large-scale persecutions and massacres carried out by invading armies, by the independent states that resulted, also by christian subjects who remained within the empire, particularly because of jewish and muslim support for ottoman integrity in fear of their fate in the emergent nationalist states of southeastern europe. the results were explosive and damaging. the invading armies of russia and austria as well as the revolting nationalists and, later, successfully established independent christian states, committed systematic genocide against jews and muslims throughout the nineteenth century, despite great power admonitions to the contrary in the treaties of paris (1858) and berlin (1878),...>> page 188: <<...as the peoples of southeastern europe achieved their independence, their muslim and jewish minorities were systematically persecuted and massacred, and those who survived were driven beyond the ever-shrinking boundaries of the retreating ottoman empire in a kind of slaughter which had not been seen since the dispersal of the jews from palestine centuries earlier. this sort of genocide had begun as long before as the late sixteenth century, with the rumanian principalities taking the lead, as united rumania did subsequently during the later years of the nineteenth century. in 1579 the ruler of moldavia, peter the lame, banished its jews because of their competition with its christian merchants. when prince micheal the brave revolted against the ottomans in the rumanian principalities of wallachia and moldavia in 1593, he ordered the massacre of all the jews as well as turks in bucharest.>> page 189: <<the slaughter continued well into the nineteenth century. when the greeks revolted against ottoman rule many greek volunteers coming from russia and the principalities to join in the effort slaughtered and plundered the jewish communities along their paths as they went through moldavia and wallachia toward greece.>> page 190 (second paragraph): <<when venice occupied the island of chios in 1694, its jewish population was either massacred or deported and all jewish communal and personal property was stolen by the native greek population, leaving those jews who returned in utter poverty and reduced to begging, no longer able to compete with the greeks in trade or commerce.>> page 190 (third paragraph): <<jews living in greece and the rumanian principalities suffered terribly because of their support for ottoman rule. when the greek nationalist movement philike etairia started its uprising in wallachia and moldavia during the spring of 1821, hundreds of jews and muslims were killed by the greeks who lived there as well as by native wallachs [14]. during the height of the greek revolution, five thousand jews were massacred in morea along with most of the muslim population, numbering about twenty thousand in all [15]. in tripolizza alone 1,200 jews were massacred along with uncounted turks [16]. reverend john hartley, after describing the carnage, concluded 'thus did jewish blood, mingled with turkish, flow down the streets of captured city. the sons of isaac and the sons of ishmael, on this as well as on every occasion during the greek revolution, met with common fate. their corpses were cast out of the city, and, like the ancient sovereign of judah, they received no burial superior to that of an ass.' [17] jewish communities on the islands of sparta, patras, corinthos, mistra, and argos were wiped out by bands of greek rebels along with those of thebes, vrachori, attica and epirus [18]. the surviving jews fled to the island of corfu, where jews who had fled from italy, and the iberian peninsula had lived in peace and prosperity under the venetian rule since the twelfth century, though divided into rival greek and italian communities. it was not long, however, before it too fell victim to the greek revolution, leading to savage repression and massacres of jews, forcing the surviving members of the two communities to come together for self-defense for the first time. throughout the years of greek revolution, greek nationalists went from town to town on the mainland and from island to island in the agean, exterminating all the jews and muslims they could find, many along the roads as they desperately fled to safety in what was left of the ottoman empire. contemporary accounts relate that the greeks left the murdered jews and muslims lying exposed so their bodies could be torn apart by the buzzards [19]. most of the jews who survived these massacres fled across the agean in small boats to izmir, thus starting its rise as one of the leading centers of ottoman jewish life during the nineteenth century. only in northern greece, particularly in the areas of janina and salonica, were the jews and the turks able to successfully resist the greek assaults, thus saving their populations from massacre as well [20]. during the remainder of the 19th century, particularly during the greek-turkish war in 1897, those jews who remained in greece in the areas of athens, chalkis, larissa, corfu and crete suffered severe persecution and massacre, forcing thousands more to emigrate into ottoman territory, particularly to salonica and izmir [21].>> page 193 (last paragraph): <<the inclusion in the treaty of berlin of stipulations providing protection for the jewish and muslim minorities in southeastern europe stimulated more popular anti-semitic and anti-muslim hysteria in all the countries involved, with blood-libel accusations once again being used as pretexts for attacking and ravaging jewish quarters as well as for new tactics for boycotting jewish shopkeepers, merchants and professionals, a movement which was quickly adapted by the christian millets in the major cities of the ottoman empire. because the bulgarians, rumanians and greeks correctly regarded the jews as supporters of the turks, both jews and turks were expelled from these countries in equally atrocious and brutal manners. their property was plundered and their homes and shops taken over without compensation, while the survivors fled in desperation to edirne and istanbul. while official statements subsequently were issued granting equal rights to jews, little was done in fact and they continued to be persecuted regularly well into the twentieth century.>> page 194 (last paragraph): <<things were not much better elsewhere in southeastern europe or the greek islands of the agean and the eastern mediterranean. in 1891 the jews on corfu were subjected to severe persecution by local greeks due to the revival of the old ritual murder accusations [26]. many of those who survived found refuge in ottoman territory with the help of a popular subscription drive carried out in istanbul under leadership of the banque camondo. in 1881 and 1884, and again in 1892 and 1903, thousands of jews came to ottoman territory as a result of pogroms in russia which went on between 1881 and 1921 with only slight periods of respite. in 1899 jewish families arrived in istanbul in flight from persecution in vidin, in independent bulgaria. the conquest of ottoman thrace and macedonia by greek and bulgarian forces during the balkan wars (1912-13), including salonica, corlu, and edirne, was followed by general attacks on jews, their synagogues, homes and shops, in both countries [27], resulting in a renewed exodus toward istanbul and beyond. two reports from salonica graphically described the situation caused by the invading armies: 'all the self-interested justifications of the newspapers of europe, all the lies which they have used to cover up the truth, can never destroy the impression of the terrible anguish which has marked the entry of the greeks in salonica. a week of terror and horror one can never easily forget. the hellenes now cruelly feel today all the damage that the explosion of hatred by the (greek) population has done to their cause. the mob has shown itself odious and the government weak...the incompetence of the greek administration and the horrors inflicted by the soldiers has put them in a terrible situation. the consuls guaranteed the absolute safety of the muslims, but sixty of them were massacred in a single night....'[28] 'it wasn't only irregulars (comitacis) who massacred, pillaged and burned. the soldiers of the army, the chief of police, and the high civil officials took an active part in the events at serres. out of 6,000 houses, 4,000 were burned. almost 1,200 shops were consumed by flames and destructive bombs. the (jewish) population lost all, and without even anything to wear is in despair. everyone wants to emigrate...'[29] page 196: <<as a result of these assaults, massacres, and forced deportations from the independent countries of southeastern europe, the ottoman empire received literally thousands of jewish refugees who joined the muslims who survived the persecution,

            "just thought i would add $0.02 to deskjet thread. i got my first one in college about 5 or so years ago. i've been a happy hp user of the deskwriter for macintosh for past 5 years. i got one just a few months after their release. and i got software revision 1.0a (now i'm up to rev. 3.1. our family (sister and father) have each purchased their own dw's after seeing mine go for one year unscathed (their stuck to their trusty imagewriter ii's). the original dw has gone for 5 years at moderate personal use. i would say that it has gone through at least 15,000 sheets, and around one (small) ink cartridge every 3 months or so. my brother might take this dw now (i'm probably gonna give it to him), and i am looking to upgrade to a color dw. the chief advantages/disadvantages i've found over the years are: advantages: quick (2-3 ppm), quiet (roomate can sleep while it's printing), appletalk networkable (unfortunately the original wasn't, so look out if you buy used. i rewired our home with phonenet appletalk connectors, and while home, we can all use my dad's one dw!), and cheap (now run ~$300). btw, you can upgrade older dw's to color or for appletalk, i dunno if hp still does the upgrades, but i received many offers (i just didn't ned it however). also, crisp laser-quality output is a wonder (used to really impress those imagewriter dot-matrix people so much so, that i had to charge $0.25 per sheet to stop my college dorm neighbors from bothering me at all hours of the night....) disadvantages. ink used to be hard to find, and wasn't cheap, and wasn't originally water-proof. while hp has done wonders with the ink (i dunno if it's still toxic), it is still subjet to smearing and running (if you run around in the damp boston rain, and get your bookbag completely soaked). ink now runs about $14-$15 for small carts (i get mine from elek-tek in chicago, i think they're now down to $12). the ink carts used to say they're dated for only 6 months, but i don't think they say so anymore. we stick to a 4 month supply (of about 3 carts). we use cheap hammerhill laser print paper (after fooling for a long time. laser/xerox paper is also good). smearing doesn't happen, unless you have a brand new ink cart and you grab the paper and smudge it all over as soon as it comes out of the machine. other disadvantages are : no postscript (this can be an advantage in speed, usually). ways around this are ghostscript or freedom of press software solutions. i bet hp probably has a ps prototype inkjet, but they won't release it for fear of hurting lj sales. in the end, the primary advantages of laser are true postscript (unless you go for cheap lasers), and fused toner (no smearing, even when soaking in water). lasers are slightly sharper, but the only instance where i needed precise layouts was printed circuit board transparencies for photoetching. i found a textronix color phaser postscript (thermal wax transfer) to work the best to make pcb negatives directly onto a transparency.",

( most of these remedies can be found in any grocery store. most of the rest of them can be found in any health food store. what is important is how they are used, and what else is excluded during their use. ) (1) the 7-day fast. 1st day: eat as much fresh fruit as you want, one kind at a time, preferably grapes. 2nd day: eat all the vegetables you want, at least half raw, including garlic; also, whole kernel corn to help scrape clean the intestinal linings. 3rd day: drink all the fresh fruit and vegetable juice you want. preferably start with 16 to 32 ounces of prune juice with pulp, followed by a gallon of pure (not from concentrate) apple juice, then grape juice. (stay close to your home bathroom.) 4th day: eat all the un-salted nuts (no peanuts) and dried fruit you want, preferably raisins and almonds (almonds contain laetrile.). 5th day: one gallon of lemonade. squeeze the juice from two lemons into a gallon of water (preferably distilled), and add 2 to 4 tablespoons of locally-made honey, (no sugar). drink one glass per hour. [everyone, including healthy people, should do this one day every week, preceded by a large glass of prune juice with pulp.] 6th day: same as 5th day. 7th day: same as 6th day. all 7 days, eat only the foods listed above for each day, along with your usual vitamin and mineral supplements, plus as much distilled water as you want. (2) the grape diet. eat 2 to 3 ounces of fresh grapes every 2 hours, 8 am to 8 pm, every day for six days. eat nothing else during the six days, but drink as much distilled water as you want. (3) apple cider vinegar. mix a teaspoon of pure apple cider vinegar (not apple cider \"flavored\" vinegar. regular vinegar is harmful.) in a glass of water (preferably distilled) and drink all of it. do this 3 or 4 times per day, for 3 weeks; then stop for a week. repeat if desired. do this along with a normal healthy diet of natural foods. this remedy is especially effective against those types of cancer that resemble a fungus, as well as against other kinds of fungus infections.

[please keep an open mind.] fill a bathtub with moderately warm water so the level comes up almost to the overflow drain when you get in. immerse yourself in it for a minute, and then completely dissolve in the bath water 1 pound of sun-evaporated sea-salt (regular salt won't work.) and 1 pound of fresh baking-soda. soak in this bath for 10 to 20 minutes, while exercising your fingers, toes, and limbs, turning sideways and onto your stomach, dunking your head, sitting up and laying back down, chomping your teeth together, etc.. among other things, the sea-salt & soda bath neutralizes the accumulated effects of x-rays, etc., as described in the book \"born to be magnetic, vol. 2\", by frances nixon, 1973. precautions: only the one person using each bath should prepare it and drain it. for at least 30 minutes after taking the bath, stay away from, and even out of sight of, other people. (your greatly expanded aura energy-field during that time could disrupt other people's fields.) two hours after the bath, eat at least 8 ounces of yogurt containing active yogurt cultures. (the bath may kill friendly bacteria also.) better yet, take a 2-billion-bacteria \"acidophilus\" capsule, which is also an excellent daily remedy against the effects of \"a.i.d.s.\" (because it kills all kinds of harmful bacteria in the digestive tract, taking a big load off the remaining immune system). [because this external bath can kill in-ternal bacteria, it may also be a cure for \"lyme disease\".] do not take this bath within a few hundred miles of a thunder storm, within 3 days of a full moon, nor during \"major\" or \"minor periods\" as listed in the \"solunar tables\" published bimonthly in \"field & stream\" magazine, (because of the measurable disruptive ambient environmental energy-fields present at those times). do not take this bath more than four times per year. (5) miscellaneous natural anti-cancer remedies: for skin cancer, apply stabilized aloe vera jel to the affected skin twice daily, and take 2 to 4 tablespoons per day of stabilized aloe vera juice internally, for about 2 months. d.m.s.o. (dimethyl sulfoxide) causes cancer cells to perform normal cell functions. almonds (un-blanched, un-roasted) contain laetrile. to help prevent cancer, eat several almonds every day. to help cure cancer, eat several ounces of almonds per day. [never take large concentrated doses of laetrile orally. it will kill you! take it intravenously only. (cancer cells contain a certain enzyme which converts laetrile into cyanide, which then kills the cell. this enzyme is also present in the digestive system.)] anti-oxidants are free-radical scavengers, and include vitamin e, selenium (200 mcg. per day is safe for most people.), chromium (up to 100 mcg. per day), vitamin a (25,000 iu per day is safe for most people.), superoxide dismutase (up to 4,000,000 units per day), vitamin c (up to 3000 mg. per day), and bht (butylated hydroxy- toluene), [1 to 4 capsules of bht every night at bedtime will also make one immune against herpes (both types), suppress herpes symptoms if one already has herpes, prevent spreading herpes to other people, but will not cure herpes. bht might also do these things against \"a.i.d.s.\", which is really a form of cancer similar to leukemia.] (see the book \"life extension\", by durk pearson and sandy shaw.) hydrogen-peroxide. dilute twelve(12) drops of 3% hydrogen-peroxide in a glass of pure water (preferably distilled) and drink it. do this once or twice per day, hours before or after eating or drinking anything else. apply 3% hydrogen-peroxide directly to skin cancers several times per day. use hydrogen-peroxide only if you are taking a good daily dose of some of the various anti-oxidants described above. vitamin & mineral supplements are more effective, and much less expensive, when combined together in mega doses into single tablets made from natural sources. cancer cells can not live in a strong (100,000 maxwell) north magnetic field, especially if it is pulsating on and off. [a strong south magnetic field is an aphrodisiac.] in my opinion, all types of ionizing- radiation treatments for cancer should be replaced with daily 30-minute doses of pulsating 100,000-maxwell north magnetic fields. properly made and operated radionics/psionics machines can both diagnose and cure all forms of cancer, as well as most other medical problems. some radionics/psionics machines can even take cross-sectional x-ray-like photos of cancer tumors, etc., with-out x-rays! interferon tablets. taheebo tea, (lapacho). homeopathy can cure cancer, and many other medical problems (even drug addiction!). 50 mg. per day of chelated zinc can help prevent or cure prostate trouble. this list is not exhaustive. the above natural remedies can cure both diagnosed and un- diagnosed cancers, as well as prevent them, and also prevent and cure many other medical problems including heart- diseases. they are not too simple and inexpensive to work effectively. besides acting on a person biologically and chemically, these remedies, especially the 7-day fast and the grape diet, send a strong message to one's subconscious mind, programming it to cure the cancer. in my opinion, if a person finds out that s/he has cancer, then s/he should promptly try at least the first 4 remedies described above, in sequence (starting with the 7-day fast), before resorting to the un-natural and expensive mutilations and agonies [poison, burn, and mutilate!] of orthodox cancer treatment [organi$ed-crime!]. disclaimer: this list was compiled from unorthodox sources that have shown themselves to be reliable. the compiler of this list is not a doctor of any kind, but is exercising his first amendment constitutional right of free speech on the subjects of his choice. for more information, contact cancer control society, 2043 n. berendo st., los angeles, ca 90027, and/or other organiza- tions listed in the \"alternative medicine\" and \"holistic medicine\" portions of the \"health and medical organizations\" section (section 8) of the latest edition of the \"encyclope- dia of associations\" reference book in your local public or university library. un-altered reproduction and dissemination of this important information is encouraged.",

            "there are a lot of people running around saying \"god told me this\" and \"god told me that\" these days. some people really have heard god, and others heard their glands. mario murrillo mentioned this in a sermon once. he said someone told him, \"the lord gave me a song.\" he said that it was the worst song he had ever heard. \"i know why he gave you that song,\" murillo said, \"he didn't want it anymore.\" but god does still speak to his people today, and the idea is contrary to the idea of a closed cannon. ireneaus wrote about all the gifts of the spirit in the church of his day (2nd and 3rd century) and he was one of the first to put forth a new testament cannon, which was almost identical to the one we have today. he believed in a closed cannon. many prophets prophesied prophecies which were not recorded in the scriptures. for example, one prophet in kings, whose name starts with an \"m\" who prophecied that the king would lose a battle. that is the only prophecy he gave recorded in scripture, and we no that he had given other prophecies because the king complained before he heard the prophecy, \"he never prophesies anything good about me.\" yet only one little paragraph of all of his lifetime of prophecies are recorded in scripture. there are numerous examples. barnabas was a prophet, acts says, before he was even sent out as an apostle. yet his writings are not recorded in scripture. only two of agabus prophecies are mentioned in scripture. he was already a prophet before he gave them. so prophecy may be genuine and from god, but that does not make it scripture. i don't know about translations of scripture, but i am familiar with prophecies that give applications for scripture. there are also similar examples in the bible. several times peter interprets prophecies in a seemingly prophetic way, for example, \"and his bishoprick let another take\" concerning judas office. a clearer example can be found in matthew 24. jesus is prophesying about what will happen before his return and he quotes a passage out of joel about the sun being darkened and the moon turning to blood. so scriptural prophecy can be used in later prophecy. sometimes this sort of thing can cross over into being a word of knowledge, but gifts of the spirit seem to overlap. words of knowledge and wisdom can overlap. the word of knowledge and prophecy can overlap. interpretation of tounges is very similar to prophecy. healings are often considered miracles. so sometimes the distinction between gifts is a bit hazy. imho, it doesn't usually matter that much if we are able to label a phenomenon, as long as we recognize them as the work of the spirit, and use them according to his leading.",

            "i'll tell you my story as an example of what *not* to do. early in 1984 i took some riding lessons from my college roommate on his old honda cb360t. he had taken the msf beginner's course, so i actually learned *some* of what i needed to know to ride. i proceeded to buy a beat-up honda cl350 for $400 and a $12 helmet and rode around wearing this and a cotton windbreaker. then i decided to invest in a full-face helmet (first smart move). sometime around then i also passed my road test. on may 4, 1984, i got caught in a rainstorm on my way home from a 4-mile trip. entering the town where i lived (a rather urban suburb), i had to stop suddenly for a red light that i noticed too late, skidded the rear tire out, and was ejected face upward into the oncoming lane of traffic. fortunately for me the oncoming traffic was also stopped for the same red light, otherwise i might have slid under a car and been killed. now this is anecdotal evidence, to be sure, but i later took the experienced rider course from the msf and saw that earlier training could have helped me greatly. in your case the need is even greater since you have nobody to help you practice even the most basic stuff as i did. so my advice is to take the msf beginner's course first thing. i wouldn't even buy a bike until you've taken the course, unless you happen to pick up a real good deal and can store it someplace until you're ready to use it. while you're waiting to take the course (it might take a few weeks in dc, as i recall there were always waiting lists in boston), could you save up some more money to start out right? say $300 for riding gear, plus the cost bike, plus maybe $100 (guess) to a mechanic to make sure the machine is safe (assuming you economize by buying some old beat-up machine from a private individual), plus insurance, plus registration and licensing fees, plus the course, you're looking at maybe $600 not including the bike itself and a reserve for ongoing maintenance. i pay about $100 insurance now (upstate ny) but it was closer to $200 in boston (more urban) for decent insurance including substantial coverage for liability, which you want unless you plan always to be poor. i'd guess dc is more like boston than like a rural area, ergo more expensive. there used to be annual buyer's guides in the usual motorcycle magazines; i found those helpful in getting an idea of what new or recent models might be available. you could probably look through past issues to size up what used bikes might be available. (my first bike was 13 years old when i bought it so i went on my friend's advice instead.) also look at the bikes that you see people riding or that are parked on the street. i basically settled on my present bike by noticing that there were a lot of high-mileage bmw's running around and they were generally set up the way i wanted. nothing wrong with talking to various dealers in your area or visiting showrooms. dealers in the boston area, at least when i was shopping, were very nice about letting you look around their showrooms and quoting prices for bikes that weren't the latest models (hence cheaper), although i ended up buying both bikes in private sales.",

            "the cold war has not ended. the only thing that has happened is that the two sides have exchanged roles. the usa has a higher imprisonment rate (400 per 100,000 population) than any country in europe by a factor of 10 or so. in california, it is over 600 per 100,000 population. the prison population in california is now over 100,000, a quadrupling since 1980. most of these inmates were convicted under the drug prohibition laws. police now confiscate property, without trial, under a \"good faith probable cause\" standard, in the name of depriving the horrible ghastly drug dealers of their ill-gotten gains. conduct an opinion poll, and a majority will answer \"yes\" if you ask them whether civil liberties and due process should be diluted in order to send our young people the message that we are serious about winning the war on drugs. i don't know whether anyone has measured such a figure among gun owners, but i would expect the same result. they certainly seem to vote that way. according to jack herer's book _the emperor wears no clothes_, over twelve million years of prison time have been served under the marijuana prohibition laws, by people who were minding their own business and causing no harm to others (and less harm to themselves than users of tobacco, with 400,000 confirmed kills/year). under the \"war on drugs\" campaign of \"zero tolerance\" due process protections have eroded, and mandatory sentences of ten years without parole have proliferated. by and large, gun owners have voted for the politicians who favor such measures. and now, all the precedents--not only legal, but political: \"my fellow americans, we must send our young people the message that we are serious about winning the war on murder\"--are going to be applied to the oncoming wave of gun prohibition laws. gun owners are about to get a taste of the medicine they voted for believing it would be used only on those with different tastes in recreational drugs. what goes around comes around.",
            "thank you, steve. it is refreshing to have someone accuse me of being a christian. i only hope enough evidence can be garnered to get a conviction. i am not certain what you mean by the \"fundy\" part as the term fundamentalist has a wide variety of uses. if you refer to those who actually believe jesus is the messiah and son of god and wish to follow in his way, then i plead guilty. but what does it matter what i think. the roman circus is over. the lions have been satisfied -- for now. the emperor, after the long and gruelling struggle, sensed the crowd was tiring and gave thumbs down. with respect to my previous comments about david koresh, i urge you to re-examine my previous posts. i believe you mistakenly assume that defense of koresh' right to his own personal beliefs and his right to express them to others implies agreement with koresh' theology. actually i understand little about the details of branch- davidian teachings and regret so many are hung-up on that aspect of the tragic events of the past few days. nor do i think koresh' sex life should be of any interest to the federal government. of course hillary says he had been molesting infants so it must be true even though such allegations do not fall under the jurisdiction of the federal government; they are state and local matters and have been thoroughly reviewed at the local level by proper authorities with no successful charge having ever been levied against him. under american law, he was innocent as americans are presumed innocent until proven guilty. at least that's how it is suppposed to be. but he was demonized and propa- gandized against by a powerful machine to have him appear as a lustful beast and therefore deserving of every ill the fates might bring upon him. but evidence trickles in that the twenty-one children, who left the building in the early days of the siege, were carefully examined by qualified authorities for evidence of physical or sexual abuse and none was found. deguerin, one of the attorneys who met with davidians several times before the conflagration, reported that the children seemed well adjusted and showed no sign of abuse. ultimately, steve, what i think about the heart of david koresh is quite unimportant. today he is in the benevolent hands of a most wise and merciful judge who will one day surely judge us all. so i withhold any judgment of david koresh and defer to the one who has all knowledge. meanwhile, let's clean up the mess left on earth and keep this from happening again by sending a strong message to the government to respect the inalienable rights of the people it serves. --joe gaut",

komsomol organization at school no. 10 member of the sumgait city komsomol committee office resident at building 17/33b, apartment 15 microdistrict no. 3 sumgait [azerbaijan] [note: the events in kafan, used as a pretext to attack armenians in azerbaijan are false, as verified by independent international human rights organizations - dd] i'm thinking about the price the sumgait armenians paid to be living in armenia now. we paid for it in human casualties and crippled fates--the price was too great! now, after the sumgait tragedy, we, the victims, divide our lives into \"before\" and ''after.\" we talk like that: that was before the war. like the people who went through world war ii and considered it a whole epoch, a fate. no matter how many years go by, no matter how long we live, it will never be forgotten. on the contrary, some of the moments become even sharper: in our rage, in our sorrow, we saw everything differently, but now . . . they say that you can see more with distance, and we can see those inhuman events with more clarity now . . . we more acutely perceive our losses and everything that happened. nineteen eighty-eight was a leap year. everyone fears a leap year and wants it to pass as quickly as possible. yet we never thought that that leap year would be such a black one for every sumgait armenian: those who lost someone and those who didn't. that second to last day of winter was ordinary for our family, although you could already smell danger in the air. but we didn't think that the danger was near and possible, so we didn't take any steps to save ourselves. at least, as my parents say, at least we should have done something to save the children. my parents themselves are not that old, 52 and 53 years. but then they thought that they had already lived enough, and did everything they could to save us. in our apartment the tragedy started on february 28, around five in the afternoon. i call it a tragedy, and i repeat: it was a tragedy even though all our family survived. when i recall how they broke down our door my skin crawls; even now, among armenians, among people who wish me only well, i feel like it's all starting over again. i remember how that mob broke into our apartment . . . my parents were standing in the hall. my father had an axe in his hands and had immediately locked both of the doors. our door was rarely locked since friends and neighbors often dropped by. we're known as a hospitable family, and we just never really thought about whether the people who were coming to see us were azerbaijanis, jews, or russians. we had friends of many nationalities, even a turkmen woman. my parents were in the hall, my father with an axe. i remember him telling my mother, \"run to the kitchen for a knife.\" but mother was detached, pale, as though she had decided to sell her life a bit dearer. to be honest i never expected it of her, she's afraid of getting shot and afraid of the dark. a girlfriend was at the house that day, a russian girl, lyuda, and mamma said, \"no matter what happens, no matter what they do to us, you're not to come out of the bedroom. we're going to tell them that we're alone in the apartment.\" we went into the bedroom. there were four of us. marina and the russian girl crawled under the bed, and we covered them up with a rug, boxes of dishes, and karina and i are standing there and looking at one another. the idea that perhaps we were seeing each other for the last time flashed somewhere inside me. i'm an emotional person and i express my emotions immediately. i wanted to embrace her and kiss her, as though it were the last second. and maybe karina was thinking the same thing, but she's quite reserved. we didn't have time to say anything to each other because we immediately heard mamma raise a shout. there was so much noise from the tramping of feet, from the shouting, and from excited voices. i couldn't figure what was going on out there because the door to the bedroom was only open a crack. but when mamma shouted the second time karina ran out of the bedroom. i ran after her, i had wanted to hold her back, but when she opened the door and ran out into the hall they saw us immediately. the only thing i managed to do was close the door behind me, at least so as to save marina and her friend. the mob was shouting, all of their eyes were shining, all red, like from insomnia. at first about 40 people burst in, but later i was standing with my back to the door and couldn't see. they came into the hall, into the kitchen, and dragged my father into the other room. he didn't utter a word, he just raised the axe to hit them, but mamma snatched the axe from behind and said, \"tell them not to touch the children. tell them they can do as they want with us, but not to harm the children.\" she said this to father in armenian. there were azerbaijanis from armenia among the mob who broke in. they understood armenian perfectly. the local azerbaijanis don't know armenian, they don't need to speak it. and one of them responded in armenian: \"you and your children both . . . we're going to do the same thing to you and your children that you armenians did in kafan. they killed our women, our girls, our mothers, they cut their breasts off, and burned our houses . . . ,\" and so on and so forth, \"and we came to do the same thing to you.\" this whole time some of them are destroying the house and the others are shouting at us. they were mostly young people, under 30. at first there weren't any older people among them. and all of their faces were unfamiliar. sumgait is a small town, all the same, and we know a lot of people by their faces, especially me, i'm a teacher. so they dragged my father into the other room. they twisted his arms and took him in there, no they didn't take him in there, they dragged him in there, because he was already unable to walk. they closed the door to that room all but a crack. we couldn't see what was happening to father, what they were doing to him. then a young man, about 26 years old, started to tear off mamma's sarafan, and mamma shouted at him in azerbaijani: \"i'm old enough to be your mother! what are you doing?!\" he struck her. now he's being held, mamma identified him. i hope he's convicted. then they went after karina, who's been talking to them like a komsomol leader, as though she were trying to lead them down a different path, as they say, to influence their consciousness. she told them that what they were doing was wrong, that they mustn't do it. she said, \"come on, let's straighten this out, without emotions. what do you want? who are you? why did you come here? what did we ever do to you?\" someone tried to explain who they were and why they had come into our home, but then the ones in the back--more of them kept coming and coming--said, \"what are you talking to, them for. you should kill them. we came here to kill them.\" they pushed karina, struck her, and she fell down. they beat her, but she didn't cry out. even when they tore her clothes off, she kept repeating, \"what did we do to you? what did we do to you?\" and even later, when she came to, she said, \"mamma, what did we do to them? why did they do that to us?\" that group was prepared, i know this because i noticed that some of them only broke up furniture, and others only dealt with us. i remember that when they were beating me, when they were tearing my clothes off, i felt neither pain nor shame because my entire attention was riveted to karina. all i could do was watch how much they beat her and how painful it was for her, and what they did to her. that's why i felt no pain. later, when they carried karina off, they beat her savagely . . . it's really amazing that she not only lived, but didn't lose her mind . she is very beautiful and they did everything they could to destroy her beauty. mostly they beat her face, with their fists, kicking her, using anything they could find. mamma, karina, and i were all in one room. and again i didn't feel any pain, just didn't feel any, no matter how much they beat me, no matter what they did. then one of those creeps said that there wasn't enough room in the apartment. they broke up the beds and the desk and moved everything into the corners so there would be more room. then someone suggested, \"let's take her outside.\" those beasts were in heaven. they did what they would do every day if they weren't afraid of the authorities. those were their true colors. at the time i thought that in fact they would always behave that way if they weren't afraid of what would happen to them. when they carried karina out and beat mamma-her face was completely covered with blood--that's when i started to feel the pain. i blacked out several times from the pain, but each moment that i had my eyes open it was as though i were recording it all on film. i think i'm a kind person by nature, but i'm vengeful, especially if someone is mean to me, and i don't deserve it. i hold a grudge a long time if someone intentionally causes me pain. and every time i would come to and see one of those animals on top of me, i'd remember them, and i'll remember them for the rest of my life, even though people tell me \"forget,\" you have to forget, you have to go on living. at some point i remember that they stood me up and told me something, and despite the fact that i hurt all over--i had been beaten terribly--i found the strength in myself to interfere with their tortures. i realized that i had to do something: resist them or just let them kill me to bring my suffering to an end. i pushed one of them away, he was a real horse. i remember now that he's being held, too. as though they were all waiting for it, they seized me and took me out onto the balcony. i had long hair, and it was stuck all over me. one of the veranda shutters to the balcony was open, and i realized that they planned to throw me out the window, because they had already picked me up with their hands, i was up in the air. as though for the last time i took a really deep breath and closed my eyes, and somehow braced myself inside, i suddenly became cold, as though my heart had sunk into my feet. and suddenly i felt myself flying. i couldn't figure out if i was really flying or if i just imagined it. when i came to i thought now i'm going to smash on the ground. and when it didn't happen i opened my eyes and realized that i was still lying on the floor. and since i didn't scream, didn't beg them at all, they became all the more wild, like wolves. they started to trample me with their feet. shoes with heels on them, and iron horseshoes, like they had spe- cially put them on. then i lost consciousness. i came to a couple of times and waited for death, summoned it, beseeched it. some people ask for good health, life, happiness, but at that moment i didn't need any of those things. i was sure that none of us would survive, and i had even forgotten about marina; and if none of us was alive, it wasn't worth living. there was a moment when the pain was especially great. i withstood inhuman pain, and realized that they were going to torment me for a long time to come because i had showed myself to be so tenacious. i started to strangle myself, and when i started to wheeze they realized that with my death i was going to put an end to their pleasures, and they pulled my hands from my throat. the person who injured and insulted me most painfully i remember him very well, because he was the oldest in the group. he looked around 48. i know that he has four children and that he considers himself an ideal father and person, one who would never do such a thing. something came over him then, you see, even during the investigation he almost called me \"daughter,\" he apologized, although, of course, he knew that i'd never forgive him. something like that i can never forgive. i have never injured anyone with my behavior, with my words, or with my deeds, i have always put myself in the other person's shoes, but then, in a matter of hours, they trampled me entirely. i shall never forget it. i wanted to do myself in then, because i had nothing to lose, because no one could protect me. my father, who tried to do something against that hoard of beasts by himself, could do nothing and wouldn't be able to do anything. i knew that i was even sure that he was no longer alive. and ira melkumian, my acquaintance i knew her and had been to see her family a couple of times--her brother tried to save her and couldn't, so he tried to kill her, his very own sister. he threw an axe at her to kill her and put an end to her suffering. when they stripped her clothes off and carried her into the other room, her brother knew what awaited her. i don't know which one it was, edik or igor. both of them were in the room from which the axe was thrown. but the axe hit one of the people carrying her and so they killed her and made her death even more excruciating, maybe the most excruciating of all the deaths of those days in sumgait. i heard about it all from the neighbor from the melkumians' landing. his name is makhaddin, he knows my family a little. he came to see how we had gotten settled in the new apartment in baku, how we were feeling, and if we needed anything. he's a good person. he said, \"you should praise god that you all survived. but what i saw with my own eyes, i, a man, who has seen so many people die, who has lived a whole life, i,\" he says, \"nearly lost my mind that day. i had never seen the likes of it and think i never shall again.\" the door to his apartment was open and he saw everything. one of the brothers threw the axe, because they had already taken the father and mother out of the apartment. igor, edik, and ira remained. he saw ira, naked, being carried into the other room in the hands of six or seven people. he told us about it and said he would never forget it. he heard the brothers shouting something, inarticulate from pain, rage, and the fact that they were powerless to do anything. but all the same they tried to do something. the guy who got hit with the axe lived. i i after i had been unsuccessful at killing myself i saw them taking marina and lyuda out of the bedroom. i was in such a state that i couldn't even remember my sister's name. i wanted to cry \"marina!\" out to her, but could not. i looked at her and knew that it was a familiar, dear face, but couldn't for the life of me remember what her name was and who she was. and thus i saved her, because when they were taking her out, she, as it turns out, had told them that she had just been visiting and that she and lyuda were both there by chance, that they weren't armenians. lyuda's a russian, you can tell right away, and marina speaks azerbaijani wonderfully and she told them that she was an azerbaijani. and i almost gave her away and doomed her. i'm glad that at least marina came out of this all in good physical health . . . although her spirit was murdered . . . at some point i came to and saw igor, igor agayev, my acquaintance, in that mob. he lives in the neighboring building. for some reason i remembered his name, maybe i sensed my defense in him. i called out to him in russian, \"igor, help!\" but he turned away and went into the bedroom. just then they were taking marina and lyuda out of the bedroom. igor said he knew marina and lyuda, that marina in fact was azerbaijani, and he took both of them to the neighbors. and the idea stole through me that maybe igor had led them to our apartment, something like that, but if he was my friend, he was supposed to save me. then they were striking me very hard--we have an indian vase, a metal one, they were hitting me on the back with it and i blacked out--they took me out onto the balcony a second time to throw me out the window. they were already sure that i was dead because i didn't react at all to the new blows. someone said, \"she's already dead, let's throw her out.\" when they carried me out onto the balcony for the second time, when i was about to die the second time, i heard someone say in azerbaijani: \"don't kill her, i know her, she's a teacher.\" i can still hear that voice ringing in my ears, but i can't remember whose voice it was. it wasn't igor, because he speaks azerbaijani with an accent: his mother is russian and they speak russian at home. he speaks azerbaijani worse than our marina does. i remember when they carried me in and threw me on the bed he came up to me, that person, and i having opened my eyes, saw and recognized that person, but immediately passed out cold. i had been beaten so much that i didn't have the strength to remember him. i only remember that this person was older and he had a high position. unfortunately i can't remember anything more. what should i say about igor? he didn't treat me badly. i had heard a lot about him, that he wasn't that good a person, that he sometimes drank too much. once he boasted to me that he had served in afghanistan. he knew that women usually like bravery in a man. especially if a man was in afghanistan, if he was wounded, then it's about eighty percent sure that he will be treated very sympathetically, with respect. later i found out that he had served in ufa, and was injured, but that's not in afghanistan, of course. i found that all out later. among the people who were in our apartment, my karina also saw the secretary of the party organization. i don't know his last name, his first name is najaf, he is an armenian-born azerbaijani. but later karina wasn't so sure, she was no longer a hundred percent sure that it was he she saw, and she didn't want to endanger him. she said, \"he was there,\" and a little while later, \"maybe they beat me so much that i am confusing him with someone else. no, it seems like it was he.\" i am sure it was he because when he came to see us the first time he said one thing, and the next time he said something entirely different. the investigators haven't summoned him yet. he came to see us in the khimik boarding house where we were living at the time. he brought groceries and flowers, this was right before march 8th; he almost started crying, he was so upset to see our condition. i don't know if he was putting us on or not, but later, after we had told the investigator and they summoned him to the procuracy, he said that he had been in baku, he wasn't in sumgait. the fact that he changed his testimony leads me to believe that karina is right, that in fact it was he who was in our apartment. i don't know how the investigators are now treating him. at one point i wondered and asked, and was told that he had an alibi and was not in our apartment. couldn't he have gone to baku and arranged an alibi? i'm not ruling out that possibility. ill now return to our apartment. mamma had come to. you could say that she bought them off with the gold father gave her when they were married: her wedding band and her watch were gold. she bought her own and her husband's lives with them. she gave the gold to a 14-year old boy. vadim vorobyev. a russian boy, he speaks azerbaijani perfectly. he's an orphan who was raised by his grandfather and who lives in sumgait on nizami street. he goes to a special school, one for mentally handicapped children. but i'll say this--i'm a teacher all the same and in a matter of minutes i can form an opinion--that boy is not at all mentally handicapped. he's healthy, he can think just fine, and analyze, too . . . policemen should be so lucky. and he's cunning, too. after that he went home and tore all of the pictures out of his photo album. he beat mamma and demanded gold, saying, \"lady, if you give us all the gold and money in your apartment we'll let you live.\" and mamma told them where the gold was. he brought in the bag and opened it, shook out the contents, and everyone who was in the apartment jumped on it, started knocking each other over and taking the gold from one another. i'm surprised they didn't kill one another right then. mamma was still in control of herself. she had been beaten up, her face was black and blue from the blows, and her eyes were filled with blood, and she ran into the other room. father was lying there, tied up, with a gag in his mouth and a pillow over his face. there was a broken table on top of the pil- low. mamma grabbed father and he couldn't walk; like me, he was half dead, halfway into the other world. he couldn't comprehend anything, couldn't see, and was covered with black and blue. mamma pulled the gag out of his mouth, it was some sort of cloth, i think it was a slipcover from an armchair. the bandits were still in our apartment, even in the room mamma pulled father out of, led him out of, carried him out of. we had two armchairs in that room, a small magazine table, a couch, a television, and a screen. three people were standing next to that screen, and into their shirts, their pants, everywhere imaginable, they were shoving shot glasses and cups from the coffee service--mamma saw them out of the corner of her eye. she said, \"i was afraid to turn around, i just seized father and started pulling him, but at the threshold i couldn't hold him up, he fell down, and i picked him up again and dragged him down the stairs to the neighbors'.\" mamma remembered one of the criminals, the one who had watched her with his face half-turned toward her, out of one eye. she says, \"i realized that my death would come from that person. i looked him in the eyes and he recoiled from fear and went stealing.\" later they caught that scoundrel. meanwhile, mamma grabbed father and left. i was alone. igor had taken marina away, mamma and father were gone, karina was already outside, i didn't know what they were doing to her. i was left all alone, and at that moment . . . i became someone else, do you understand? even though i knew that neither mother and father in the other room, nor marina and lyuda under the bed could save me, all the same i somehow managed to hold out. i went on fighting them, i bit someone, i remember, and i scratched another. but when i was left alone i realized what kind of people they were, the ones i had observed, the ones who beat karina, what kind of people they were, the ones who beat me, that it was all unnecessary, that i was about to die and that all of that would die with me. at some point i took heart when i saw the young man from the next building. i didn't know his name, but we would greet one another when we met, we knew that we were from the same microdistrict. when i saw him i said, \"neighbor, is that you?\" in so doing i placed myself in great danger. he realized that if i lived i would remember him. that's when he grabbed the axe. the axe that had been taken from my father. i automatically fell to my knees and raised my hands to take the blow of the axe, although at the time it would have been better if he had struck me in the head with the axe and put me out of my misery. when he started getting ready to wind back for the blow, someone came into the room. the newcomer had such an impact on everyone that my neighbor's axe froze in the air. everyone stood at attention for this guy, like soldiers in the presence of a general. everyone waited for his word: continue the atrocities or not. he said, \"enough, let's go to the third entryway.\" in the third entryway they killed uncle shurik, aleksandr gambarian. this confirms once again that they had prepared in advance. almost all of them left with him, as they went picking up pillows, blankets, whatever they needed, whatever they found, all the way up to worn out slippers and one boot, someone else had already taken the other. four people remained in the room, soldiers who didn't obey their general. they had to have come recently, because other faces had flashed in front of me over those 2 to 3 hours, but i had never seen those three. one of them, kuliyev (i identified him later), a native of the sisian district of armenia, an azerbaijani, had moved to azerbaijan a year before. he told me in armenian: \"sister, don't be afraid, i'll drive those three azerbaijanis out of here.\" that's just what he said, \"those azerbaijanis,\" as though he himself were not azerbaijani, but some other nationality, he said with such hatred, \"i'll drive them out of here now, and you put your clothes on, and find a hammer and nails and nail the door shut, because they'll be coming back from apartment 41.\" that's when i found out that they had gone to apartment 41. before that, the person in the eskimo dogskin coat, the one who came in and whom they listened to, the \"general,\" said that they were going to the third entryway. kuliyev helped me get some clothes on, because l couldn't do it by myself. marina's old fur coat was lying on the floor. he threw it over my shoulders, i was racked with shivers, and he asked where he could find nails and a hammer. he wanted to give them to me so that when he left i could nail the door shut. but the door was lying on the floor in the hall. i went out onto the balcony. there were broken windows, and flowers and dirt from flowerpots were scattered on the floor. it was impossible to find anything. he told me, \"well, fine, i won't leave you here. would any of the neighbors let you in? they'll be back, they won't calm down, they know you're alive.\" he told me all this in armenian. then he returned to the others and said, \"what are you waiting for? leave!\" they said, \"ah, you just want to chase us out of here and do it with her yourself. no, we want to do it to.\" he urged them on, but gently, not coarsely, because he was alone against them, although they were still just boys, not old enough to be drafted. he led them out of the room, and went down to the third floor with them himself, and said, \"leave. what's the mat- ter, aren't you men? go fight with the men. what do you want of her?\" and he came back upstairs. they wanted to come up after him and he realized that he couldn't hold them off forever. then he asked me where he could hide me. i told him at the neighbors' on the fourth floor, apartment 10, we were on really good terms with them. we knocked on the door, and he explained in azerbaijani. the neighbor woman opened the door and immediately said, \"i'm an azerbaijani.\" he said, \"i know. let her sit at your place a while. don't open the door to anyone, no one knows about this, i won't tell anyone. let her stay at your place.\" she says, \"fine, have her come in.\" i went in. she cried a bit and gave me some stockings, i had gone entirely numb and was racked with nervous shudders. i burst into tears. even though i was wearing marina's old fur coat, it's a short one, a half-length, i was cold all the same. i asked, \"do you know where my family is, what happened to them?\" she says, \"no, i don't know anything. i'm afraid to go out of the apartment, now they're so wild that they don't look to see who's azerbaijani and who's armenian.\" kuliyev left. ten minutes later my neighbor says, \"you know, lyuda, i don't want to lose my life because of you, or my son and his wife. go stay with someone else.\" during the butchery in our apartment one of the scum, a sadist, took my earring in his mouth--i had pearl earrings on--and ripped it out, tearing the earlobe. the other earring was still there. when i'm nervous i fix my hair constantly, and then, when i touched my ear, i noticed that i had one earring on. i took it out and gave it to her. she took the earring, but she led me out of the apartment. i went out and didn't know where to go. i heard someone going upstairs. i don't know who it was but assumed it was them. with tremendous difficulty i end up to our apartment, i wanted to die in my own home. i go into the apartment and hear that they are coming up to our place, to the fifth floor. i had to do something. i went into the bedroom where marina and lyuda had hidden and saw that the bed was overturned. instead of hiding i squatted near some broken christmas ornaments, found an unbroken one, and started sobbing. then they came in. someone said that there were still some things to take. i think that someone pushed me under the bed. i lay on the floor, and there were broken ornaments on it, under my head and legs. i got all cut up, but i lay there without moving. my heart was beating so hard it seemed the whole town could hear it. there were no lights on. maybe that's what saved me. they were burning matches, and toward the end they brought in a candle. they started picking out the clothes that could still be worn. they took father's sport jacket and a bedspread, the end of which was under my head. they pulled on the one end, and it felt like they were pulling my hair out. i almost cried out. and again i realized i wasn't getting out of there alive, and i started to strangle myself again. i took my throat in one hand, and pressed the other on my mouth, so as not to wheeze, so that i would die and they would only find me afterward. they were throwing the burned matches under the bed, and i got burned, but i withstood it. something inside of me held on, someone's hand was protecting me to the end. i knew that i was going to die, but i didn't know how. i knew that if i survived i would walk out of that apartment, but if i found out that one of my family had died, i would die for sure, because i had never been so close to death and couldn't imagine how you could go on living without your mother or father, or without your sister. marina, i thought, was still alive: she went to lyuda's place or someone is hiding her. i tried to think that igor wouldn't let them be killed. he served in afghanistan, he should protect her. while i was strangling myself i said my good-byes to everyone. and then i thought, how could marina survive alone. if they killed all of us, how would she live all by herself? there were six people in the room. they talked among themselves and smoked. one talked about his daughter, saying that there was no children's footwear in our apartment that he could take for his daughter. another said that he liked the apartment--recently we had done a really good job fixing everything up--and that he would live there after everything was all over. they started to argue. a third one says, \"how come you get it? i have four children, and there are three rooms here, that's just what i need. all these years i've been living in god-awful places.\" another one says, \"neither of you gets it. we'll set fire to it and leave.\" then someone said that azerbaijanis live right next door, the fire could move over to their place. and they, to my good fortune, didn't set fire to the apartment, and left. oh, yes, i just remembered. while they were raping me they repeated quite frequently, \"let the armenian women have babies for us, muslim babies, let them bear azerbaijanis for the struggle against the armenians.\" then they said, \"those muslims can carry on our holy cause. heroes!\" they repeated it very often. - - - reference for #008 - - - [1] _the sumgait tragedy; pogroms against armenians in

            "i don't know the first thing about yeast infections but i am a scientist. no scientist would take your statement --- \"no convincing empirical evidence to support the existence of systemic yeast syndrome\" --- to tell you anything except an absence of data on the question. noring has pointed out the catch-22 that if the \"crazy\" theory were true, you probably couldn't find any direct evidence of it --- that you couldn't observe those yeastie beasties with present methods even if they were there. noring and the fellow from oklahoma (sorry, forgot your name) have also suggested one set of anecdotal evidence in favor based on their personal experiences --- namely, that when people with certain conditions are given anti-fungals, many of them appear to get better. so, if you have any evidence *against* the hypothesis --- for example, controlled double-blind studies showing that the anti-fungals don't do any better than sugar water --- then let's hear it. if you don't, then what we have is anecdotal and uncontrolled evidence on one side, and abject disbelief on the other. in which case, please, there is no point in yelling back and forth at each other any longer since neither side has any convincing evidence either positive or negative. and i understand that your abject disbelief is based on the existence of people who may get famous or make money applying the diagnosis to everything in sight, making wild claims with no evidence, and always refusing to do controlled studies. but that has absolutely no bearing on the apparently sincere experiences of the people on the net observing anti-fungals working on themselves and other people in certain specific cases. there are also quacks who sell oral superoxide dismutase, in spite of the fact that it's completely broken down in the guts, but this doesn't change the genuine scientific knowledge about the role of superoxide dismutase in fighting oxidative damage. same thing. just cause there are candida quacks, that doesn't establish evidence against the candida hypothesis. if there's some other reason (besides the quacks), if only anecdotal, to think it could be true, then that is what has to be considered, that is what the net people have been talking about. but again, there is no point in arguing about it. there is anecdotal evidence, and there is no convincing evidence, and there are also some candida quacks out there, i hope everyone can agree on all of that. thus, it appears to me the main question now is whether the proponents can marshall enough anecdotal evidence in a convincing and documented enough manner to make a good case for carrying out a good controlled double-blind study of antifungals (or else, forget convincing anybody else to carry out the test, just carry it out themselves!) --- and also, whether they can adequately define the patient population or symptoms on which such a study should be carried out to provide a fair test of the hypothesis. ken",

            "[ . . .] i am a relativist who would like to answer your question, but the way you phrase the question makes it unanswerable. the concepts of \"right\" and \"wrong\" (or \"correct/incorrect\" or \"true/false\") belong to the domain of epistemological rather than moral questions. it makes no sense to ask if a moral position is right or wrong, although it is legitimate to ask if it is good (or better than another position). let me illustrate this point by looking at the psychological derivatives of epistemology and ethics: perception and motivation, respectively. one can certainly ask if a percept is \"right\" (correct, true, veridical) or \"wrong\" (incorrect, false, illusory). but it makes little sense to ask if a motive is true or false. on the other hand, it is strange to ask whether a percept is morally good or evil, but one can certainly ask that question about motives. therefore, your suggested answers (a)-(c) simply can't be considered: they assume you can judge the correctness of a moral judgment. now the problem with (d) is that it is double-barrelled: i agree with the first part (that the \"rightness\" of a moral position is a meaningless question), for the reasons stated above. but that is irrelevant to the alleged implication (not an implication at all) that one cannot feel peace is better than war. i certainly can make value judgments (bad, better, best) without asserting the \"correctness\" of the position. sorry for the lengthy dismissal of (a)-(d). my short (e) answer is that when two individuals grotesquely disagree on a moral issue, neither is right (correct) or wrong (incorrect). they simply hold different moral values (feelings).",

            "i can not believe the way this thread on candida(yeast) has progressed. steve dyer and i have been exchanging words over the same topic in sci. med. nutrition when he displayed his typical reserve and attacked a women poster for being treated by a liscenced physician for a disease that did not exist. calling this physician a quack was reprehensible steve and i see that you and some of the others are doing it here as well. let me tell you who the quacks really are, these are the physicans who have no idea how the human body interacts with it's environment and how that balance can be altered by diet and antibiotics. these are the physicians who dismiss their patients with difficult symptomatology and make them go from doctor to doctor to find relief(like elaine in sci. med. nutrition) and then when they find one that solves their problem, the rest start yelling quack. could it just be professional jealousy? i couldn't help elaine or jon but somebody else did. could they know more than me? no way, they must be a quack. i've been teaching a human nutrition course for medical students for over ten years now and guess who the most receptive students are? those that were raised on farms and saw first-hand the effect of diet on the health of their farm animals and those students who had made a dramatic diet change prior to entering medical school(switched to the vegan diet). typically, this is about 1/3 of my class of 90 students. those not interested in nutrition either tune me out or just stop coming to class. that's okay because i know that some of what i'm teaching is going to stick and there will be at least a few \"enlightened\" physicians practicing in the u.s. it's really too bad that most u.s. medical schools don't cover nutrition because if they did, candida would not be viewed as a non-disease by so many in the medical profession. in animal husbandry, an animal is reinnoculated with \"good\" bacteria after antibiotics are stopped. medicine has decided that since humans do not have a ruminant stomach, no such reinnoculation with \"good\" bacteria is needed after coming off a braod spectrum antibiotic. humans have all kinds of different organisms living in the gi system(mouth, stomach, small and large intestine), sinuses, vagina and on the skin. these are nonpathogenic because they do not cause disease in people unless the immune system is compromised. they are also called nonpathogens because unlike the pathogenic organisms that cause human disease, they do not produce toxins as they live out their merry existence in and on our body. but any of these organisms will be considered pathogenic if it manages to take up residence within the body. a poor mucus membrane barrier can let this happen and vitamin a is mainly responsible for setting up this barrier. steve got real upset with elaine's doctor because he was using anti-fungals and vitamin a for her gi problems. if steve really understoood what vitamin a does in the body, he would not(or at least should not) be calling elaine's doctor a quack. here is a brief primer on yeast. yeast infections, as they are commonly called, are not truely caused by yeasts. the most common organism responsible for this type of infection is candida albicans or monilia which is actually a yeast-like fungus. an infection caused by this organism is called candidiasis. candidiasis is a very rare occurance because, like an e. coli infection, it requires that the host immune system be severly depressed. candida is frequently found on the skin and all of the mucous membranes of normal healthy people and it rarely becomes a problem unless some predisposing factor is present such as a high blood glucose level(diabetes) or an oral course of antibiotics has been used. in diabetics, their secretions contain much higher amounts of glucose. candida, unlike bacteria, is very limited in it's food(fuel) selection. without glucose, it can not grow, it just barely survives. if it gets access to a lot of glucose, it blooms and over rides the other organisms living with it in the sinuses, gi tract or vagina. in diabetics, skin lesions can also foster a good bloom site for these little buggers. the bloom is usually just a minor irritant in most people but some people do really develop a bad inflammatory process at the mucus membrane or skin bloom site. whether this is an allergic like reaction to the candida or not isn't certain. when the bloom is in the vagina or on the skin, it can be easliy seen and some doctors do then try to \"treat\" it. if it's internal, only symptoms can be used and these symptoms are pretty nondiscript. candida is kept in check in most people by the normal bacterial flora in the sinuses, the gi tract(mouth, stomach and intestines) and in the vaginal tract which compete with it for food. the human immune system ususally does not bother itself with these(nonpathogenic organisms) unless they broach the mucus membrane \"barrier\". if they do, an inflammatory response will be set up. most americans are not getting enough vitamin a from their diets. about 30% of all american's die with less vitamin a than they were born with(u.s. autopsy studies). while this low level of vitamin a does not cause pathology(blindness) it does impair the mucus membrane barrier system. this would then be a predisposing factor for a strong inflammatory response after a candida bloom. while diabetics can suffer from a candida \"bloom\" the most common cause of this type of bloom is the use of broad spectrum antibiotics which knock down many different kinds of bacteria in the body and remove the main competition for candida as far as food is concerned. while drugs are available to handle candida, many patients find that their doctor will not use them unless there is evidence of a systemic infection. the toxicity of the anti-fungal drugs does warrant some caution. but if the gi or sinus inflammation is suspected to be candida(and recent use of a broad spectrum antibiotic is the smoking gun), then anti-fungal use should be approrpriate just as the anti-fungal creams are an appropriate treatment for recurring vaginal yeast infections, in spite of what mr. steve dyer says. but even in patients being given the anti-fungals, the irritation caused by the excessive candida bloom in the sinus, gi tract or the vagina tends to return after drug treatment is discontinued unless the underlying cause of the problem is addressed(lack of a \"good\" bacterial flora in the body and/or poor mucus membrane barrier). lactobacillus acidophilus is the most effective therapy for candida overgrowth. from it's name, it is an acid loving organism and it sets up an acidic condition were it grows. candida can not grow very well in an acidic environment. in the vagina, l. acidophilius is the predominate bacteria(unless you are hit with broad spectrum antibiotics). in the gi system, the ano-rectal region seems to be a particularly good reservoir for candida and the use of pantyhose by many women creates a very favorable environment around the rectum for transfer(through moisture and humidity) of candida to the vaginal tract. one of the most effctive ways to minimmize this transfer is to wear undyed cotton underwear. if the bloom occurs in the anal area, the burning, swelling, pain and even blood discharge make many patients think that they have hemorroids. if the bloom manages to move further up the gi tract, very diffuse symptomatology occurs(abdominal discomfort and blood in the stool). this positive stool for occult blood is what sent elaine to her family doctor in the first place. after extensive testing, he told her that there was nothing wrong but her gut still hurt. on to another doctor, and so on. richard kaplan has told me throiugh e-mail that he considers occult blood tests in stool specimens to be a waste of time and money because of the very large number of false positives(candida blooms guys?). if my gut hurt me on a constant basis, i would want it fixed. yes it's nice to know that i don't have colon cancer but what then is causing my distress? when i finally find a doctor who treats me and gets me 90% better, steve dyer calls him a quack. candida prefers a slightly alkaline environment while bacteria tend to prefer a slightly acidic environment. the vagina becomes alkaline during a woman's period and this is often when candida blooms in the vagina. vinegar and water douches are the best way of dealing with vaginal problems. many women have also gotten relief from the introduction of lactobacillus directly into the vaginal tract(i would want to be sure of the purity of the product before trying this). my wife had this vagina problem after going on birth control pills and searched for over a year until she found a gynocologist who solved the problem rather than just writting scripts for anti-fungal creams. this was a woman gynocologist who had had the same problem(recurring vaginal yeast infections). this m.d. did some digging and came up with an acetic acid and l. acidophilis douche which she used in your office to keep it sterile. after three treatments, sex returned to our marraige. i have often wondered what an m.d. with chronic gi distress or sinus problems would do about the problem that he tells his patients is a non-existent syndrome. the nonpathogenic bacteria l. acidophilus is an acid producing bacteria which is the most common bacteria found in the vaginal tract of healthy women. if taken orally, it can also become a major bacteria in the gut. through aresol sprays, it has also been used to innoculate the sinus membranes. but before this innoculation occurs, the mucus membrane barrier system needs to be strengthened. this is accomplished by vitamin a, vitamin c and some of the b-complex vitamins. diet surveys repeatedly show that americans are not getting enough b6 and folate. these are probably the segement of the population that will have the greatest problem with this non-existent disorder(candida blooms after antibiotic therapy). some of the above material was obtained from \"natural healing\" by mark bricklin, published by rodale press, as well as notes from my human nutrition course. i will be posting a discussion of vitamin a sometime in the future, along with reference citings to point out the extremely important role that vitamin a plays in the mucus membrane defense system in the body and why vitamin a should be effective in dealing with candida blooms. another effective dietary treatment is to restrict carbohydrate intake during the treatment phase, this is especially important if the gi system is involved. if candida can not get glucose, it's not going to out grow the bacteria and you then give bacteria, which can use amino acids and fatty acids for energy, a chance to take over and keep the candida in check once carbohydrate is returned to the gut. if steve and some of the other nay-sayers want to jump all over this post, fine. i jumped all over steve in sci. med. nutrition because he verbably accosted a poster who was seeking advice about her doctor's use of vitamin a and anti-fungals for a candida bloom in her gut. people seeking advice from newsnet should not be treated this way. those of us giving of our time and knowledge can slug it out to our heart's content. if you saved your venom for me steve and left the helpless posters who are timidly seeking help alone, i wouldn't have a problem with your behavior. martin banschbach, ph.d. professor

            "we are having a problem with a quadra 950 that has stumped a couple of techs sent to us by the vendor, as well as us :-) this quadra is 'stuffed' with 64mb ram, 2mb vram and some large disk (400mb i think). what happens is that after a certain variable interval of time the video circuitry 'loses' vertical sync. it is quite apparent that the mac cpu is still ok, and the problem really seems to lie with the video circuitry, since you can still save your documents, quit your aplpications, even pull down menus etc. (only the display is scrolling lik crazy, so it's pretty hard to hit menu items ;-) we had the original logic board replaced twice now, and the same problem has been occurring on all boards although the inteval between occurrences has varied. the first board had this problem every about 1hr, more often if the cache was turned off (yes off). this is the only symptom that is not obviously related to the video circuitry (after all the cache is on the cpu right?). the second board had the problem every about 10 minutes (we did not keep it, rather we put the original back), the current board we have has this problem a lot less often (has gone about a week without doing it, but did it twice within an hour yesterday). the technicians that have come out to try to figure it out seemed pretty sharp and tried a number of sensible things (most of which we had previously tried ourselves anyway). these included: -swapping the ram -swapping the vram -swapping monitors (3 different 13\" apple rgb and 2 16\" apple rgb) -swapping cables -disconnecting hd and booting from floppy -sacrificing various small mammals here are some other facts: -when we put a rasterops procolor 32 on the nubus, the problem is fixed (it does not occur with the internal video or the procolor video out) -the vendor cannot reproduce the problem back in their shop on the boards that exhibit it in our lab -apple is said to be getting a little bit pissed off at shipping us boards that they cannot find anything wrong with, and getting them shipped back as faulty according to us. here are some speculations: -i bet that neither apple nor the vendor has tested these boards with that much ram and vram on them simultaneaously, which may have something to do with their finding it hard to reproduce the problem (though we can reproduce it with just 4mb of ram, so this is probably a red herring). -the vendor's representative blames 'metal in your walls' - claims that our walls have metal in them which interferes with the mac's operation. we have another 950 in the lab which works like a charm (though it's not in the exact same spot....) please don't tell me this is probably it, i do not want to believe it. -it's probably not poltergeists, since they do not have badges to get past security at the entrance to our site. has anyone any ideas? please? please email as well as posting cause i seem to be spending a lot of time rebooting my mac lately and have a lot less time available to read news! :-) thank you in advance. carlo tiana nasa ames research center carlo@vision.arc.nasa.gov",

(note that grafsys also provides drawing routines so you don't have to worry about that if you don't want to) grafsys 1.11 comes in two versions. one for the 881 and 020 or above processors. the other version uses fixed-point arithmetic and runs on any mac. both versions are *100% source compatibel*. grafsys comes with an extensive manual that teaches you the fundamentals of 3d graphics and how to use the package. if demand is big enough i will convert the grafsys to an object-class library. however, i feelt that the way it is implemented now makes it easier to use for a lot more people than the select 'oop-guild'. grafsys is free for any non-commercial usage. read the documentation enclosed.",

            "yes the govt handled it in the rambo hollywood type style with extreeme machismo. perhaps thats not the way to handle it. it is a completely different thing to start asserting as many have done that the government is primarily to blame. the comparisons with the nazis in particular are purely gratuitous. since you have provided a constructive opinion on the issue your post desreves to be taken seriously. peter nelson also made some very good points about how a low key approach might have been more effective. the point is though that you learn through mistakes. the govt played the wrong card and lost. thats not a big deal. they had had four guys murdered at the begining and maybee they just were not prepared for wuite this situation. who could be? if the same thing were to happen all over again we might perhaps be able to castigate the govt if they used the same tactics and failed in the same way. as it is i can't say that i would not have made the same mistake. maybee i wouldn't because i don't as a rule go in for a confrontational situation if i can avoid it. maybee i would because with all those press about its very difficult not to try the macho stuff. the fbi had information from within the compound we had no access to. they may have calculated that the b-d followers resolve was cracking based on their listening devices within the compound. they knew that koresh had chickened out of one suicide attempt. this may have been the reason why they considered that fear might have been a weapon for breaking his resolve. again in panama they had used the heavy rock music to great effect during bush's invasion. funny that few of the koresh supporters and appologists complain much about the death of several thousand pananmanian civilians while the us govt attempted to arrest their former ally. koresh negated his civil rights the minute his followers fired on the police helicopter. no matter whether the warrant was or was not technically valid the guys who were carrying it out thought that it was. thus the assault on them was completely inexcusable no matter what rationalisation people might wish to employ. of course we have to consider the guns issue. that is the whole core of the question. everything else is a diversion.",

            "so far simmons looks like a total idiot. 1) zane smith should learn how to \"switchpitch\" and return from the dl. i would rather have zane smith pitch right handed than have moeller pitch at all. 2) i am sure simmons was ready to say i told you so after otto had an impressive win last week. now otto's latest debacle has restored simmon's reputation. now he looks like he is back in his '92 form when he had the al's highest era among starters. four our sake(not ted's sake), i hope he pitches with a 3.5 era for the rest of the season. yeah, right. 3) tomlin and merced are a bit disappointing. they are still doing decently. but considering the considerable amount of talent and maturity they have shown their first seasons, they seem to have actually gotten a little bit worse. tomlin was almost unhittable his rookie year against lefty batters. merced had a very good oba his rookie year. he showed a lot of concentration at the plate in his rookie year. 4) walk: well, he seems to be on the losing end tonight. but i still think that walk desrved his contract. 5) leyland should accept a part of the blame for the lavalliere situation. i can't understand his and management's fear of losing tom prince through waivers. even if they do, what's the use. he is aright hander like slaught. not a very smart platoon. also, i am blaming leyland in this case, since he is hcurrently convinced that lavalliere is through, while giving him way too much time last year in the regular season and the playoffs(slaught should have played in all 7 games; he has a good average against right handed pitching). didn't leyland and simmons forsee this last year, and attempt to trade lavalliere last year itself? any fool could tell them lavalliere wasn't very fit last year. 6) dennis moeller is scary!!! 7) candeleria: well, he is not going to have such a high era at the end of the season. maybe it will be in 3-4 range. but $1 million plus? come on. other than the customary home run giving stage patterson goes through for a few weeks, patterson has served the pirates very well each year. so far, he seems to have pitched well for the rangers. i think the pirates should have spent the money on patterson in stead. 8) the rookie batters: well, young has surprised me a bit with his instant impact. other than that, their excellent performance hasn't been too much of a surprise. i think we should thank doughty for that. 9) rookie pitchers: worse than expected, especially cooke. 10) slaught: how come he wasn't given a contract extension last year? now his value has increased immensely. 11) lonnie smith!! well, eric davis was signed for a comparable amount. let's see. eric can hit better. he can run better. he can field better. now why didnt the pirates go after eric davis. an injured davis is better than a healthy lonnie smith. even if lonnnie smith gets some big hits this year,he won't be an asset. he has looked terrible on the bases and in the field. 12) management: big big zero. sauer has yet to make a forceful agreement in favor of revenue sharing. he seems more concerned about pleasing that idiot danforth by preparing the team for a move to tampa bay. 13) alex cole fiasco. the pirates infield and cf positions look good. the rf and lf would have looked good if we could have gotten cole to replace two of the four outfielders. eric davis, van slyke and cole would have made a very respectable outfield. even without eric davis, thye pirates would have a respectable outfield with cole, svan slyke, and merced(i think he should hit left handed against lefts in stead of switch hitting). simmons did have options for the outfield. ironically, the biggest accomplishment of simmon's tenure was getting alex cole really cheap. too bad. 14) compensatory draft picks for bonds: forget it. the pirates can rant and rave. they will not get those picks. as of now, the issue is still being appealed. now, if this doesnt convince anyone that simmons and sauer are idiots, nothing else will. on a final note. tim wakefield won't be as awful as he was in his last 2 starts. but don't count on him pitching like last year for the rest of the season. also, if the pirates are in contention towards rthe end of the season, they will miss redus's clutch hitting and his speed(he has peaked in the second half of the last 2 seasons)>",

            "i know it doesn't make sense, but since when is 'napoleon' about sense, anyway? further striking bigoted and racist attitude of certain greeks still exists in our day. most greeks insist even today, that the 537 year-old capital of the ottoman empire should be called not by its rightful name of istanbul, but by its half a millennium-old moniker 'cons*(whatever).' everyone knows that new york city was once called 'new amsterdam' but dutch people do not persist on calling it that today. the name of stalingrad too is long gone, replaced by volgagrad. china's peking traded its name for beiging long ago. ciudad trujillo of the dominican republic is now santa domingo. zimbabve's old colonial capital salisburry became harrare. these changes have all been accepted officially by everyone in the world. but, greeks are still determined on calling the turkish istanbul by the name of 'cons*.' how can one explain this total intransigence? what makes greeks so different from other mortals? 18-year-old questionable democracy? why don't they seem to reconcile with the fact, for instance, that istanbul changed hands 537 years ago in 1453 ad, and that this predates the discovery of the new world, by 39 years. the declaration of u.s. independence in 1776 will come 284 years later. shouldn't then, half a millennium be considered enough time for 'cons*' to be called a turkish city? where is the logic in the greek reasoning, if there is any? how long can one sit on the laurels of an ancient civilization? ancient greece does not exist, any more than any other 16 civilizations that existed on the soil of anatolia. these undereducated 'wieneramus' live with an illusion. it is the same mentality which allows them to rationalize that cyprus is a greek island. no history book shows that it ever was. it belonged to the ottoman turks 'lock, stock and barrel' for a period of well over 300 years. in fact, prior to the turks' acquisition of it, following bloody naval battles with the venetians in 1570 ad, the island of cyprus belonged, invariably, to several nations: the assyrians, the sumerians, the phoenicians, the egyptians, the ottoman turks, of course in that order, owned it as their territory. but, it has never been the possession of the government of greece - not even for one day - in the history of the world. moreover, cyprus is located 1500 miles from the greek mainland, but only 40 miles from turkiye's southern coastline. saddam hussein claims that kuwait was once iraqi territory and the greek cypriot government and the terrorist greek governments think that cyprus also was once part of the greek hegemony. those 'arromdians' involved in this grandiose hallucination should wake up from their sweet daydreams and confront reality. again, wishful thinking is unproductive, only facts count. as for selanik, <<those jews who survived these assaults in southeastern europe fled particularly to salonica, whose jewish population increased substantially as a result, from 28,000 in 1876 to 90,000 in 1908, more than half the total population, though even there increased persecution by local greeks led many jews to flee elsewhere in the ottoman empire, particularly to the great port of izmir. despite all the pressure from ottomans and foreign jews alike, the ritual murders and other assaults by christians on jews went on and on. greek efforts to decimate the jewish population of salonica culminated in 1912 and 1913, following greek conquest of salonica during the first balkan war, when many of its jews, were either killed or terrorized into leaving...>> <<though greece was obligated by the post world war i treaties to allow jews and other minorities to use their own languages in education and to practice their religions without hindrance, a law was issued in 1923 which forbad all inhabitants from working on sunday, stimulating a new jewish exodus as it was intended to do. between 1932 and 1934 there was a series of anti-semitic riots in salonica, with the cambel quarter, where most of the remaining jews lived, being burned to the ground. this was followed by regulations requiring the use of greek and prohibiting hebrew and judea-spanish in the jewish schools. a start was made also on expropriating the land of the principal jewish cemetery in salonica for use by the new university in order to derive the jews out [47]. by killing and driving out large numbers of jews, the greeks left a substantial greek majority in the city for the first time, and starting salonica jewry on the way to its final decimation by the nazis during the occupation of greece starting in 1941. salonica and izmir of course were not the only places of refuge for jewish refugees entering the empire during its last century of existence. istanbul, edirne, and other parts of rumelia and anatolia received thousands more. nor were jews the only refugees received and helped by the government of the sultan. thousands of muslims accompanied them in flight from similar persecutions wherever balkan christian states gained independence or expanded. the russian conquest of the crimea and the caucasus starting in the late eighteenth century, and particularly during and after the crimean war, combined with the same independence movements in southeastern europe that had caused so much suffering and flight among its jews caused thousands of helpless, ill, and poverty-stricken muslim refugees to accompany them into the ever shrinking boundaries of the ottoman empire, with the istanbul government struggling mightly but vainly to house and feed them as best it could. from 1850 to 1864 as many as 800,000 crimean tatars, circassians, and other muslims from north and east of the black sea had entered anatolia alone, as many as 200,000 more came during the next twenty years, while 474,389 refugees entered in 1876- 1877 as a result of the ottoman wars with russia and the balkan states, with an equal number gaining refuge in the european portions of the empire.>> [47] robert mantran, 'la structure sociale de la communaute juive de salonqiue a la fin du dix-neuvieme siecle', rh no.534 (1980), 391-92; nehama vii,

automotive transport production association resident at building 17/33b, apartment 40 microdistrict no. 3 sumgait [azerbaijan] what happened in sumgait was a great tragedy, an awful tragedy for us, the armenian people, and for all of mankind. a genocide of armenians took place during peacetime. and it was a great tragedy for me personally, because i lost my father in those days. he was still young. born in 1926. on that day, february 28, we were at home. of course we had heard that there was unrest in town, my younger brother aleksandr had told us about it. but we didn't think . . . we thought that everything would happen outdoors, that they wouldn't go into people's apartments. about five o'clock we saw a large crowd near the kosmos movie theater in our microdistrict. we were sitting at home watching television. we go out on the balcony and see the crowd pour into mir street. this is right near downtown, next to the airline ticket office, our house is right nearby. that day there was a group of policeman with shields there. they threw rocks at those policemen. then they moved off in the direction of our building. they burned a motorcycle in our courtyard and started shouting for armenians to come out of the building. we switched off the light. as it turns out, their signal was just the opposite: to turn on the light. that meant that it was an azerbaijani home. we, of course, didn't know and thought that if they saw lights on they would come to our apartment. suddenly there's pounding on the door. we go to the door, all four of us: there were four of us in the apartment. father, mother, my younger brother aleksandr, and i. he was born in 1959. my father was a veteran of world war ii and had fought in china and in the soviet far east; he was a pilot. we went to the door and they started pounding on it harder, breaking it down with axes. we start to talk to them in azerbaijani, \"what's going on? what's happened?\" they say, \"armenians, get out of here!\" we don't open the door, we say, \"if we have to leave, we'll leave, we'll leave tomorrow.\" they say, \"no, leave now, get out of here, armenian dogs, get out of here!\" by now they've broken the door both on the lock and the hinge sides. we hold them off as best we can, my father and i on one side, and my mother and brother on the other. we had prepared ourselves: we had several hammers and an axe in the apartment, and grabbed what we could find to defend ourselves. they broke in the door and when the door gave way, we held it for another half-hour. no neighbors, no police and no one from the city government came to our aid the whole time. we held the door. they started to smash the door on the lock side, first with an axe, and then with a crowbar. when the door gave way--they tore it off its hinges--sasha hit one of them with the axe. the axe flew out of his hands. they also had axes, crowbars, pipes, and special rods made from armature shafts. one of them hit my father in the head. the pressure from the mob was immense. when we retreated into the room, one of them hit my mother, too, in the left part of her face. my brother sasha and i fought back, of course. sasha is quite strong and hot-tempered, he was the judo champion of sumgait. we had hammers in our hands, and we injured several of the bandits--in the heads and in the eyes, all that went on. but they, the injured ones, fell back, and others came to take their places, there were many of them. the door fell down at an angle. the mob tried to remove the door, so as to go into the second room and to continue . . . to finish us off. father brought skewers and gave them to sasha and me--we flew at them when we saw father bleeding: his face was covered with blood, he had been wounded in the head, and his whole face was bloody. we just threw ourselves on them when we saw that. we threw ourselves at the mob and drove back the ones in the hall, drove them down to the third floor. we came out on the landing, but a group of the bandits remained in one of the rooms they were smashing all the furniture in there, having closed the door behind them. we started tearing the door off to chase away the remaining ones or finish them. then a man, an imposing man of about 40, an azerbaijani, came in. when he was coming in, father fell down and mother flew to him, and started to cry out. i jumped out onto the balcony and started calling an ambulance, but then the mob started throwing stones through the windows of our veranda and kitchen. we live on the fourth floor. and no one came. i went into the room. it seemed to me that this man was the leader of the group. he was respectably dressed in a hat and a trench coat with a fur collar. and he addressed my mother in azerbaijani: \"what's with you, woman, why are you shouting? what happened? why are you shouting like that?\" she says, \"what do you mean, what happened? you killed somebody!\" my father was a musician, he played the clarinet, he played at many weddings, armenian and azerbaijani, he played for many years. everyone knew him. mother says, \"the person who you killed played at thousands of azerbaijani weddings, he brought so much joy to people, and you killed that person.\" he says, \"you don't need to shout, stop shouting.\" and when they heard the voice of this man, the 15 to 18 people who were in the other room opened the door and started running out. we chased after them, but they ran away. that man left, too. as we were later told, downstairs one of them told the others, i don't know if it was from fright or what, told them that we had firearms, even though we only fought with hammers and an axe. we raced to father and started to massage his heart, but it was already too late. we asked the neighbors to call an ambulance. the ambulance never came, although we waited for it all evening and all through the night. somewhere around midnight about 15 policemen came. they informed us they were from khachmas. they said, \"we heard that a group was here at your place, you have our condolences.\" they told us not to touch anything and left. father lay in the room. so we stayed home. each of us took a hammer and a knife. we sat at home. well, we say, if they descend on us again we'll defend ourselves. somewhere around one o'clock in the morning two people came from the sumgait procuracy, investigators. they say, \"leave everything just how it is, we're coming back here soon and will bring an expert who will record and photograph everything.\" then people came from the republic procuracy too, but no one helped us take father away. the morning came and the neighbors arrived. we wanted to take father away somehow. we called the procuracy and the police a couple of times, but no one came. we called an ambulance, and nobody came. then one of the neighbors said that the bandits were coming to our place again and we should hide. we secured the door somehow or other. we left father in the room and went up to the neighbor's. the excesses began again in the morning. the bandits came in several vehicles, zil panel trucks, and threw themselves out of the vehicles like . . . a landing force near the center of town. our building was located right there. a crowd formed. then they started fighting with the soldiers. then, in buildings 19 and 20, that's next to the airline ticket office, they started breaking into armenian apartments, destroying property, and stealing. the armenians weren't at home, they had managed to flee and hide somewhere. and again they poured in the direction of our building. they were shouting that there were some armenians left on the fourth floor, meaning us. \"they're up there, still, up there. let's go kill them!\" they broke up all the furniture remaining in the two rooms, threw it outside, and burned it in large fires. we were hiding one floor up. something heavy fell. sasha threw himself toward the door shouting that it was probably father, they had thrown father, were defiling the corpse, probably throwing it in the fire, going to burn it. i heard it, and the sound was kind of hollow, and i said, \"no, that's from some of the furniture.\" mother and i pounced on sasha and stopped him somehow, and calmed him down. the mob left somewhere around eight o'clock. they smashed open the door and went into the apartment of the neighbors across from us. they were also armenians, they had left for another city. the father of the neighbor who was concealing us came and said, \"are you crazy? why are you hiding armenians? don't you now they're checking all the apartments? they could kill you and them!\" and to us :\" . . . come on, leave this apartment!\" we went down to the third floor, to some other neighbors'. at first the man didn't want to let us in, but then one of his sons asked him and he relented. we stayed there until eleven o'clock at night. we heard the sound of motors. the neighbors said that it was armored personnel carriers. we went downstairs. there was a light on in the room where we left father. in the other rooms, as we found out later, all the chandeliers had been torn down. they left only one bulb. the bulb was burning, which probably was a signal they had agreed on because there was a light burning in every apartment in our microdistrict 3 where there had been a pogrom. with the help of the soldiers we made it to the city party committee and were saved. our salvation--my mother's, my brother's, and mine,--was purely accidental, because, as we later found out from the neighbors, someone in the crowd shouted that we had firearms up there. well, we fought, but we were only able to save mother. we couldn't save father. we inflicted many injuries on the bandits, some of them serious. but others came to take their places. we were also wounded, there was blood, and we were scratched all over--we got our share. it was a miracle we survived. we were saved by a miracle and the troops. and if troops hadn't come to sumgait, the slaughter would have been even greater: probably all the armenians would have been victims of the genocide. through an acquaintance at the city party committee i was able to contact the leadership of the military unit that was brought into the city, and at their orders we were assigned special people to accompany us, experts. we went to ' pick up father's corpse. we took it to the morgue. this was about two o'clock in the morning, it was already march 1, it was raining very hard and it was quite cold, and we were wearing only our suits. when my brother and i carried father into the morgue we saw the burned and disfigured corpses. there were about six burned people in there, and the small corpse of a burned child. it was gruesome. i suffered a tremendous shock. there were about ten people there, but the doctor on duty said that because of the numbers they were being taken to baku. there was a woman's corpse there too, she had been . . . well, there was part of a body there . . . a hacked-off part of a woman's body. it was something terrible. the morgue was guarded by the landing force . . . the child that had been killed was only ten or twelve years old. it was impossible to tell if it was a boy or a girl because the corpse was burned. there was a man there, too, several men. you couldn't tell anything because their faces were disfigured, they were in such awful condition... now two and a half months have passed. every day i recall with horror what happened in the city of sumgait. every day: my father, and the death of my father, and how we fought, and the people's sorrow, and especially the morgue. i still want to say that 70 years have passed since soviet power was established, and up to the very last minute we could not conceive of what happened in sumgait. it will go down in history. i'm particularly surprised that the mob wasn't even afraid of the troops. they even fought the soldiers. many soldiers were wounded. the mob threw fuel mixtures onto the armored personnel carriers, setting them on fire. they weren't afraid. they were so sure of their impunity that they attacked our troops. i saw the clashes on february 29 near the airline ticket office, right across from our building. and that mob was fighting with the soldiers. the inhabitants of some of the buildings, also azerbaijanis, threw rocks at the soldiers from windows, balconies, even cinder blocks and glass tanks. they weren't afraid of them. i say they were sure of their impunity. when we were at the neighbors' and when they were robbing homes near the airline ticket office i called the police at number 3-20-02 and said that they were robbing armenian apartments and burning homes. and they told me that they knew that they were being burned. during those days no one from the police department came to anyone's aid. no one came to help us, either, to our home, even though perhaps they could have come and saved us. as we later found out the mob was given free vodka and drugs, near the bus station. rocks were distributed in all parts of town to be thrown and used in fighting. so i think all of it was arranged in advance. they even knew in which buildings and apartments the armenians lived, on which floors--they had lists, the bandits. you can tell that the \"operation\" was planned in advance. thanks, of course, to our troops, to the country's leadership, and to the leadership of the ministry of defense for helping us, thanks to the russian people, because the majority of the troops were russians, and the troops suffered losses, too. i want to express this gratitude in the name of my family and in the name of all armenians, and in the name of all sumgait armenians. for coming in time and averting terrible things: worse would have happened if that mob had not been stopped on time. at present an investigation is being conducted on the part of the ussr procuracy. i want to say that those bandits should receive the severest possible punishment, because if they don't, the tragedy, the genocide, could happen again. everyone should see that the most severe punishment is meted out for such deeds. very many bandits and hardened hooligans took part in the unrest, in the mass disturbances. the mobs were huge. at present not all of them have been caught, very few of them have been, i think, judging by the newspaper reports. there were around 80 people near our building alone, that's how many people took part in the pogrom of our building all in all. they should all receive the most severe punishment so that others see that retribution awaits those who perform such acts. may 18, 1988 yerevan - - - reference - - - [1] _the sumgait tragedy; pogroms against armenians in soviet

(2) it seems probable that no one displayed the body of jesus because no one knew where it was. i personally believe that the most likely explanation was that the body was stolen (by disciples, or by graverobbers). don't bother with the point about the guards ... it only appears in one gospel, and seems like exactly the sort of thing early christians might make up in order to counter the grave-robbing charge. the new testament does record that jews believed the body had been stolen. if there were really guards, they could not have effectively made this claim, as they did.",

            "note: followups to comp.dcom.modems (for obvious reasons) the courier is their top-of-the-line product, thus the higher price. i've never taken a real look at the sportster line (only couriers), but from what i've gathered, it's basically more of an entry-level modem. probably doesn't meet the same specifications that the courier does. i'm not sure if the sportster line is fully dsp driven like the (more recent) courier modems are, so upgrades in the future may be an issue. again, take all of the above with a grain of salt...i've never evaluated the sportster, so i'm going by bits and pieces that i've heard. if you want a real answer, post the question in comp.dcom.modems and you'll find people who have worked with the sportster. personally, though, if i were going to look at the courier modems, i'd buy the dual standard...then i'd get both hst and v.32bis. in fact, this is exactly what i did. :-) i'm sitting here looking at my usr ds right now. and now, to correct a few very incorrect statements.... folks, if you want to get reliable answers to modem and/or uart questions, post them to comp.dcom.modems. if you post in other groups, you never know what you'll get in the way of an answer (you may very well get a good answer...or you may get something like the one below). at least in cdm, if someone posts complete and utter bs, you'll see a flurry of folks correcting them (to avoid spreading faulty info). just as it does at lower speeds, too. there is absolutely nothing in either ccitt recommendation v.42 or v.42bis that says that they can only operate on modems that are running v.32bis. v.42bis, of course, is currently only *standardized* for operation on top of v.42 (in its primary mode of operation, lapm), but that's about as far as that goes. and just in case there's some confusion on this, v.42/v.42bis are also supported by the courier line (unless you have a really ancient one). take a second look at the original question: ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ see the v.32bis up there? the question was not about the courier hst modem, or about the courier dual standard...it was about the courier v.32bis modem. the modem in question does not support hst, period. it therefore does not support the 16.8 kb hst. also, not all courier hst / courier dual standard modems support the 16.8 kb version of hst. my dual standard only supports hst at 14.4 kb. there are even older models that only run hst at 9.6 kb. hst is usr's proprietary modulation scheme.... but we're not talking about hst, we're talking about v.32bis. v.32bis is most definitely *not* a proprietary modulation scheme. i do hope you didn't mean for these two sentences to be related in some way..... first off, v.32 and v.32bis are both synchronous and asynchronous. this is part of the ccitt recommendation (i.e., part of the standard). it isn't a feature unique to the sportster (i just looked at the appropriate chapter in the courier ds manual). second, hst is not ``one way only.'' more correctly put, it is an asymmetrical modulation scheme, meaning it doesn't work at the same speed in both directions. hst operates at [9.6 / 14.4 / 16.8] in one direction, and has a low-speed back-channel in the other direction. the high-speed channel goes in the direction of the higher data flow. this is fine if you're logged on to say, a bbs, and type one letter and get screens of info back, transfer files (not using bimodem), etc.... there is, of course, a penalty for turnaround time when the high-speed channel needs to reverse directions. v.32 and v.32bis are both symmetrical, meaning they do transfer the full data rate in both directions at the same time. third, synchronous vs asynchronous has absolutely nothing to do with symmetrical vs asymmetrical...they are two completely different topics. again, more correctly put, *some* of the courier line will be upgradeable to whatever ``v.fast'' is called when it's complete. if you have the large footprint courier modems (like i do), you're s.o.l..... there was an upgrade plan a while back to upgrade to a small footprint variety, which could eventually be upgraded to support v.fast, but the cost of the two upgrades together pretty much put it higher than just buying a new modem. later..... --jim -- #include <std_disclaimer.h> 73 de n5ial (/4) ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ internet: jim@n5ial.mythical.com | j.graham@ieee.org icbm: 30.23n 86.32w amateur radio: n5ial@w4zbb (ft. walton beach, fl) amtor selcal: nial",

(the fact pattern gives no information as to which came first, the plaintiff's acquisition of the land or he defendant's start of production at their cement plant.) in the course of its regular operations, the cement plant did injury to the plaintiffs' property via dirt, smoke and vibrations emanating from the plant. the plaintiffs sought injunctive relief -- that is, they asked the court to order atlantic cement to stop damaging their property. (commentary: this seems entirely reasonable to me. boomer at al owned their property and, presumably, a right to quiet enjoyment of it. atlantic cement's actions were depriving boomer et al of that right.) instead of granting the plaintiffs' request for an injunction, the court ordered them to accept the damage being done to their property, provided that atlantic cement paid them $185,000 in compensatory damages. in other words, the court granted atlantic cement co., a private party, the power and authority to _take_ the plaintiffs rights to quiet enjoyment of their property by eminent domain. a taking by eminent domain is always problematical even when it's done by the state; allowing a private firm to do it is, in my opinion, totally wrong. (yes, i know, the _boomer_ court didn't call it eminent domain. but if it walks like eminent domain and swims like eminent domain and quacks like eminent domain...) let me take issue with the way you've presented the case... you say that \"what happened in _boomer_ was that the judge didn't allow the plaintiffs to blackmail the cement plant by demanding a multi-million dollar plant to be shut down over $185,000 in damages.\" blackmail? (pulls out black's law dictionary, abridged 5th edition.... \"blackmail: unlawful demand of money or property under threat to do bodily harm, to injure property, to accuse of crime, or to expose disgraceful defects. this crime is commonly included under extortion statutes.\") how do you define as \"blackmail\" one party's act of demanding the right to set its own sale price for a unique piece of property which it owns and which another party has expressed an interest in buying? or of demanding the right not to sell that property at any price? as i see it, boomer et al, having found themselves in the fortunate position of owning something which atlantic cement had to purchase if it wanted to stay in business, had every right in the world to set whatever price they wanted. there isn't, or at least shouldn't be, any law that says that you have to be a nice guy in your private business dealings. you go on to say: \"the plant would never have been shut down -- the plaintiff's lawyers would have just negotiated a windfall settlement, because the plaintiffs would prefer an amount greater than $185k to having the plant shut down, while the plant would prefer any amount less than the value of the plant to have the plant continue in operation.\" if so, so what? since when are the courts supposed to be in the business of preventing parties from reaping windfall settlements from other parties when those settlements arise from wrongful acts by those other parties? if atlantic cement didn't want to have to face a choice between paying a windfall settlement or going out of business, well, shouldn't atlantic cement have thought of that before going _into_ business? (i note that as far as the facts show boomer et al were _not_ the parties responsible for bringing about this situation -- that was atlantic cement's own fault for choosing to build and operate the type of plant they did where and when they did.) and then you say: \"everyone's property rights were protected; the plaintiffs were made whole; unnecessary settlement costs were avoided.\" as above, i dispute your claim that the plaintiffs were \"made whole.\" they were, in fact, by court action deprived of their rights as owners of property to choose to sell or not sell that property at a price acceptable to them. and for that deprivation they were _not_ made whole. and again i ask: since when are the courts supposed to be in the business of ensuring that \"unnecessary\" settlement costs are avoided? (if so, i've been miseducated -- i always thought that the courts were supposed to be in the business of ensuring that justice is done.) (1) _boomer_ is not being taught as \"infamous,\" at least not at my school. (aside: northeastern law usually does a very good job of hiring for their first-year, mandatory classes (such as torts, where i first encountered _boomer_) instructors who, regardless of their personal opinions, can and do teach the law neutrally. when the students get into their second and third years, in which the students (a) can pick and choose which courses to take (except for the mandatory professional responsibility, of course) and (b) are presumed to be a bit more worldly and self-confident, less likely to be consciously or sub-consciously intimidated by law school professors and able to learn from openly biased instructors rather than be indoctrinated by them, the instructors tend to be more open in expressing their own opinions. this is especially true of part-time instructors who, in real life, are practicing attorneys or sitting judges... this can be _very_ educational, sometimes far more so than being taught by a somewhat cloistered scholar. end of aside.) i called it infamous because that's my opinion of it. for the reasons i've stated above, i believe it to be a triumph of something that i can only call \"economic correctness\" over justice. (2) it is \"completely sensible\" only if you believe that the alleged right of the owners of atlantic cement to stay in business and avoid losing a lot of their own money due to their own wrongful act, and the alleged right of several hundred atlantic cement employees to not have their jobs disappear, should trump the rights of people who own property which was damaged by atlantic cement's wrongful acts. (and if you believe that it is correct for the courts (or any other branch of government) to grant to private parties the right to take other people's property by eminent domain.) really? i didn't know that... what, if anything, has he had to say about cases like _boomer_? i've admitted that my understanding of the field generally referred to as \"law and economics\" is weak. if it advocates the use of economical analysis as one of many \"tie-breaker\" factors which courts may use to help them reach decisions in cases in which the dispute, as measured by the scale of \"justice\", is evenly balanced, fine. but as illustrated by _boomer_, it is _not_ fine when the courts start viewing the economics of a case as being more important than the justice of a case.",

'they *realy* belong in society' is a catchy phrase but i'm personally waiting to see what the texas rangers have to say about it all before i pass judgment. why don't you do the same. some more interesting facts about the waco incident: 1) the original assault was conducted by batf officers wearing an assorted types of camouflage. i saw, on cnn, at least three different types. i would be hard pressed to identify a bunch of guys in 'bring-your-own' battle fatigues as uniformed officers of the law even if they were claiming to be police. 2) the batf has been lying from the beginning: + \"we only had handguns\" - the original footage showed 4 batf officers on a roof top getting shot at, one had an mp-5 assault sub-machine gun. + \"we were out gunned\" - sub-machine guns and shotguns are the best in quarters weapon, you can't be out gunned when you have the best guns available for the job. + \"we didn't know they had guns that would shoot through doors!\" - this one is the best, there are very few guns that won't shoot through a household door, or through a house wall for that matter. since officers from the bureau of alcohol, tobacco, and *firearms* should know that, they are either lying or incredibly incompetent. not to mention criminally negligent if they are shooting bullets that they think will stop when the encounter plywood. + \"we had a search warrant. actually, we had an arrest warrant. no, wait, we had both. yeah, that's the ticket. oh, and they're child molesters too. and they make *drugs*. did we mention we think they have rocket launchers.\" - the story from batf and fbi spokespeople has changed daily and their claims were getting increasingly outrageous. 3) throughout the siege the fbi and batf have be claiming that one of their biggest concerns was that koresh and his followers would mass suicide. now they are claiming that that's what he did and that they are surprised that he did. huh? all in all i think that anything the fbi and batf say should be taken with a grain or two of salt. rob.",

(david hammerslag) how do you (mormons) reconcile the idea of eternal marriage with christ's statement that in the resurrection people will neither marry nor be given in marriage (luke, chapt. 20)? footnotes in some bibles reference this verse to the book of tobit. tobit is in the septuagint. goodspeed published it in a book called \"the apocrypha\". most any bookstore will have this. at any rate, the jews of christ's day had this book. it is a story mostly centered around the son of tobit who was named tobias. there was a young lady, sarah, who had entered the bridal chamber with seven brothers in succession. the brothers all died in the chamber before consumating the marriage. tobias was entitled to have sarah for his wife (3:17) because tobias was her only relative and \"...she was destined for [tobias] from the beginning\" (6:17). tobias took her to wife and was able to consumate the marriage. the seven husbands would not have her as a partner in heaven. that does not eliminate tobias, her eighth husband. tobit is a fun and interesting story to read. it's kind of a mythical romance. it's a little shorter than esther. the lds also have scriptures that parallel and amplify luke 20. most notably doctrines and covenants 132:15-16. \"therefore, if a man marry him a wife in the world, and he marry her not by me nor by my word, and he covenant with her so long as he is in the world and she with him, their covenant and marriage are not of force when they are dead, and when they are out of the world; therefore, they are not bound by any law when they are out of the world. \"therefore, when they are out of the world they neither marry nor are given in marriage; but are appointed angels in heaven, which angels are ministering servants, to minister for those who are worthy of a far more, and an exceeding, and an eternal weight of glory.\"",

            "hello all, i thought you all might like to see this. it's a letter from jerry berman to david chaum from november of 1985, in response to information that mr. chaum sent to mr. berman. while i have to congratulate eff for its prompt response to the clipper chip announcement from the white house, i think it's important to recognize the philosophy of their executive director, as explained below. i agree that legal remedies are important, but when pressed, i'd prefer to retain the ability to use purely technical solutions to preserve my privacy, because they'll hold up under fire. mr. chaum has consented to the publication of this letter on the net. i don't work for, nor am i a member of eff, aclu, or any similar organizations, but i do agree with them on a great many things. --aristophanes ---------- american civil liberties union washington office 122 maryland avenue, ne november 1, 1985 washington, dc 20002 -------------------- national headquarters mr. david chaum 132 west 43rd street centre for mathematics and computer science new york. ny 10036 p.o. box 4079 (212) 944-9800 19o9 ab amsterdam norman dorsen president dear mr. chaum: ira glasser executive director eleanor holmes norton chair national advisory council thank you for sending me a most interesting article. a society of individuals and organizations that would expend the time and resources to use a series of 'digital pseudonyms' to avoid data linkage does not in my opinion make big brother obsolete but acts on the assumption that big brother is ever present. i view your system as a form of societal paranoia. as a matter of principle, we are working to enact formal legal protections for individual privacy rather than relying on technical solutions. we want to assume a society of law which respects legal limits rather than a society that will disobey the law, requiring citizens to depend on technical solutions. e.g. require a judical warrant for government interception of data communications rather than encrypt all messages on the assumption that regardless of the lawt the government will abuse its power and invade privacy. as a matter of practicality, i do not think your system offers much hope for privacy. first, the trend toward universal identifiers is as much.-a movement generated by government or industry's desire to keep track of all citizens as it is by citizens seeking simplicity and convenience in all transactions. at best, your system would benefit the sophisticated and most would opt for simplicity. the poor and the undereducated would never use or benefit from it. finally where there's a will, there's a way. if government wants to link data bases, it will, by law, require the disclosure of various individual pseudonyms used by citizens or prohibit it for data bases which the government wants to link. since corporations make money by trading commercial lists with one another, they will never adopt the system or if it is adopted, will use \"fine printn contracts to permit selling various codes used by their customers to other firms. the solution remains law, policy, and consensus about limits on government or corporate intrusion into areas of individual autonomy. technique can be used to enforce that consensus or to override it. it cannot be used as a substitute for such consensus. sincerely yours, /sig/ jerry j. berman chief legislative counsel & direrector aclu privacy technology project",

'cause it can't, i'll wager. actually, i have wagered, i quit trying to make fractal compression work- and i was trying- because i don't think it's a reasonable alternative to other techniques. it is neat, though. :-) i'll reiterate my disbelief that everything is fractal. that's why i don't think fractal compression as it is widely explained is practical. i know barnsley and sloan have some tricks up their sleeves that make their demos work, but i don't see anyone using it in a real product. it's been six years since iterated systems was formed, right? \"there are always going to be questions until there's a product out there,\" sloan replies. the company plans to ship its first encoding devices in the summer, he says. in march, iterated systems will have the other half of the system: the decoders. - scientific american, march 1990, page 77",

it does not therefore appear useful when used with windows. cost: $79.95; quantity discounts, site licenses. comments: the keystroke-counting approach looks good: it seems better to measure the activity that is causing you problems than to measure clock time or even typing time. the marketing stuff is very good and includes some summaries of research papers, as well as lots of arguments you can use to get your company to pay up for rsi management tools. tool: eyercise (commercial software) available from: ran enterprises one woodland park dr. haverhill, ma 01830, us tel: 800-451-4487 (us only) platforms: windows (3.0/3.1), os/2 pm (1.3/2.0) [not dos] description: aimed at preventing rsi and eye strain, this program warns you to take breaks after a configurable interval (or at fixed times). optionally displays descriptions and pictures of exercises - pictures are animated and program beeps you to help you do exercises at the correct rate. includes 19 stretches and 4 visual training exercises, can configure which are included and how many repetitions you do - breaks last from 3 to 7 minutes. also includes online help on workplace ergonomics. quote from their literature: \"eyercise is a windows program that breaks up your day with periodic sets of stretches and visual training exercises. the stretches work all parts of your body, relieving tension and helping to prevent repetitive strain injury. the visual training exercises will improve your peripheral vision and help to relieve eye strain. together these help you to become more relaxed and productive.\" \"the package includes the book _computers & visual stress_ by edward c. godnig, o.d. and john s. hacunda, which describes the ergonomic setup for a computer workstation and provides procedures and exercises to promote healthy and efficient computer use. cost: $69.95 including shipping and handling, quantity discounts for resellers. free demo ($5 outside us). comments: i have a copy of this, and it works as advertised: i would say it is better for rsi prevention than rsi management, because it does not allow breaks at periods less than 30 minutes. also, it interrupts you based on clock time rather than typing time, which is not so helpful unless you use the keyboard all day. worked ok on windows 3.0 though it did occasionally crash with a uae - not sure why. also refused to work with the space bar on one pc, and has one window without window controls. very usable though, and does not require any sound hardware. tool: lifeguard (commercial software) available from: visionary software p.o. box 69447 portland, or 97201, us tel: +1 (503) 246-6200 platforms: mac, dos (windows version underway) description: aimed at preventing rsi. warns you to take a break with dialog box and sound. includes a list of exercises to do during breaks, and information on configuring your workstation in an ergonomic manner. price: $59; quantity discounts and site licenses. the dos product is bought in from another company, apparently; not sure how equivalent this is to the mac version. the mac version got a good review in desktop publisher magazine (feb 1991). good marketing stuff with useful 2-page summaries of rsi problems and solutions, with references. tool: stressfree (commercial software, free usable demo) available from: lifetime software p.o. box 87522 houston texas 77287-7522, us tel: 800-947-2178 (us only) fax: +1 (713) 474-2067 mail: 70412.727@compuserve.com demo (working program but reduced functions) available from: compuserve: windows advanced forum, new uploads section, or health and fitness forum, issues at work section. anon ftp: ftp.cica.indiana.edu (and mirroring sites) platforms: windows (3.0/3.1) (mac and dos versions underway) description: aimed at preventing rsi, this program warns you to take breaks after a configurable interval (or at fixed times). displays descriptions and pictures of exercises - pictures are animated and program paces you to help you do exercises at the correct rate. quite a few exercises, can configure which ones are included to some extent. online help. version 2.0 is out soon, mac and dos versions will be based on this. cost: $29.95 if support via compuserve or internet, otherwise $39.95. site license for 3 or more copies is $20.00 each. (note: prices may have gone up for v2.0). comments: i have had a play with this, and it works ok. its user interface design is much better in 2.0, though still a bit unusual. expensive tool around and it does the job. it is also the only tool with a redistributable demo, so if you do get the demo, post it on your local bulletin boards, ftp servers and bitnet servers! does not include general info on rsi and ergonomics, but it does have the ability to step backward in the exercise sequence, which is good for repeating the most helpful exercises. tool: typewatch (freeware), version 3.8 (october 1992) available from: email to richardd@hoskyns.co.uk anonymous ftp: soda.berkeley.edu:pub/typing-injury/typewatch.shar platforms: unix (tested on sco, sunos, mach; character and x window mode) description: this is a shell script that runs in the background and warns you to stop typing, based on how long you have been continuously typing. it does not provide exercises, but it does check that you really do take a break, and tells you when you can start typing again. typewatch now tells you how many minutes you have been typing today, each time it warns you, which is useful so you know how much you *really* type. it also logs information to a file that you can analyse or simply print out. the warning message appears on your screen (in character mode), in a pop-up window (for x windows), or as a zephyr message (for those with athena stuff). tim freeman <tsf@cs.cmu.edu> has put in a lot of bug fixes, extra features and support for x, zephyr and mach. not formally supported, but email richardd@hoskyns.co.uk (for sco, sunos, character mode) or tsf@cs.cmu.edu (for mach, x window mode, zephyr) if you have problems or want to give feedback. tool: various calendar / batch queue programs available from: various sources platforms: various description: any calendar/reminder program that warns you of an upcoming appointment can be turned into an ad hoc rsi management tool. or, any batch queue submission program that lets you submit a program to run at a specific time to display a message to the screen. using windows as an example: create a calendar file, and include this filename in your win.ini's 'load=' line so you get it on every startup of windows. suppose you want to have breaks every 30 minutes, starting from 9 am. press f7 (special time...) to enter an appointment, enter 9:30, hit enter, and type some text in saying what the break is for. then press f5 to set an alarm on this entry, and repeat for the next appointment. by using windows recorder, you can record the keystrokes that set up breaks throughout a day in a .rec file. put this file on your 'run=' line, as above, and you will then, with a single keypress, be able to set up your daily appointments with rsi exercises. the above method should be adaptable to most calendar programs. an example using batch jobs would be to submit a simple job that runs at 9:30 am and warns you to take a break; this will depend a lot on your operating system. while these approaches are not ideal, they are a good way of forcing yourself to take a break if you can't get hold of a suitable rsi management tool. if you are techie enough you might want to write a version of typewatch (see above) for your operating system, using batch jobs or whatever fits best. tool: digital watches with count-down timers available from: various sources, e.g. casio bp-100. description: many digital watches have timers that count down from a settable number of minutes; they usually reset easily to that number, either manually or automatically. while these are a very basic tool, they are very useful if you are writing, reading, driving, or doing anything away from a computer which can still cause or aggravate rsi. the great advantage is that they remind you to break from whatever you are doing. comments: my own experience was that cutting down a lot on my typing led to my writing a lot more, and still reading as much as ever, which actually aggravated the rsi in my right arm though the left arm improved. getting a count-down timer watch has been very useful on some occasions where i write a lot in a day. i have tried an old fashioned hour-glass type egg timer, but these are not much good because they do not give an audible warning of the end of the time period! keyboard remapping tools: these enable you to change your keyboard mapping so you can type one-handedly or with a different two-handed layout. one-handed typing tools may help, but be very careful about how you use them -- if you keep the same overall typing workload you are simply doubling your hand use for the hand that you use for typing, and may therefore make matters worse. tool: hsh (public domain) available from: anonymous ftp: soda.berkeley.edu:pub/typing-injury/hsh.shar platforms: unix (don't know which ones) description: allows one-handed typing and other general keyboard remappings. only works through tty's (so, you can use it with a terminal or an xterm, but not most x programs). tool: dvorak keyboard tools (various) available from: anonymous ftp: soda.berkeley.edu:pub/typing-injury/xdvorak.c also built into windows 3.x. description: the dvorak keyboard apparently uses a more rational layout that involves more balanced hand use. it *may* help prevent rsi a bit, but you can also use it if you have rsi, since it will slow down your typing a *lot* :-)",

            "undoubtedly. in fact, it is the fact that hospitals frequently compete for physicians rather than for patients that (in part) complicates and undermines a simplistic free-market analysis of the market for medical care. once again, there is no evidence that this is true in regard to kidney dialysis. although price controls have promoted an expansion of services to a much greater volume of patients, rd is still a profitable service. otherwise, one would expect to see evidence of rationing rather than the vast expansion that has occurred. can you spell \"loss leader?\" i knew you could. grocery stores do not attempt to make up the loss on an individual product by selling more of it. in fact, your argument above is that kidney dialysis is a loss leader for other medical treatments where lost revenue can be regained. but the evidence does not support this contention. rather, it appears that price controls have disciplined the market by forcing an expansion of service and development of improved lower-cost technology to provide comparable benefits. providers continue to profit from rd, they simply make less on each treatment than they would have if the price had risen at the rate that uncontrolled treatments have. there is no question that had price controls forced the price of rd substantially below its actual cost that some or all of the doomsday predictions of free-market advocates would have been seen -- restriction of service, lagging technological development, etc. likewise, it appears that in the va and armed forces medical care systems, where providers are government agencies, some of these negative impacts may occur. (rd patients in the va system in spokane, for example, must travel to seattle, 300 miles away, for treatment.) the bottom line, however, is that this is an example of government intervention (of a rather extreme sort) that appears to have had beneficial results for both providers and consumers. claims that \"government bureaucracy\" inevitably leads to undesirable outcomes in the marketplace should take such such cases into account. jsh",

            "there's a lot of evidence, it just hasn't been adequately gathered and published in a way that will convince the die-hard melancholic skeptics who quiver everytime the word 'anecdote' or 'empirical' is used. for example, dr. ivker, who wrote the book \"sinus survival\", always gives, before any other treatment, a systemic anti-fungal (such as nizoral) to his new patients if they've been on braod-spectrum anti-biotics 4 or more times in the last two years. he's kept a record of the results, and for over 2000 patients found that over 90% of his patients get significant relief of allergic/sinus symptoms. of course, this is only the beginning for his program. in my case, as i reported a few weeks ago, i was developing the classic symptoms outlined in 'the yeast connection' (i agree it is a poorly written book): e.g., extreme sensitivity to plastics, vapors, etc. which i never had before (started in november). within one week of full dosage of sporanox, the sensitivity to chemicals has fully disappeared - i can now sit on my couch at home without dying after two minutes. i'm also *greatly* improved in other areas as well. of course, i have allergy symptoms, etc. i am especially allergic to molds, yeasts, etc. it doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out that if one has excessive colonization of yeast in the body, and you have a natural allergy to yeasts, that a threshold would be reached where you would have perceptible symptoms. also, yeast do produce toxins of various sorts, and again, you don't have to be a rocket scientist to realize that such toxins can cause problems in some people. in my case it was sinus since that's the center of my allergic response. of course, the $60,000 question is whether a person who is immune compromised (as tests showed i was from over 5 years of antibiotics, nutritionally-deficiencies because of the stress of infections and allergies, etc.), can develop excessive yeast colonization somewhere in the body. it is a tough question to answer since testing for excessive yeast colonization is not easy. one almost has to take an empirical approach to diagnosis. fortunately, sporanox is relatively safe unlike past anti-fungals (still have to be careful, however) so there's no reason any longer to withhold sporanox treatment for empirical reasons. btw, some would say to try nystatin. unfortunately, most yeast grows hyphae too deep into tissue for nystatin to have any permanent affect. you'll find a lot of people who are on nystatin all the time. in summary, i appreciate all of the attempts by those who desire to keep medicine on the right road. but methinks that some who hold too firmly to the party line are academics who haven't been in the trenches long enough actually treating patients. if anybody, doctors included, said to me to my face that there is no evidence of the 'yeast connection', i cannot guarantee their safety. for their incompetence, ripping off their lips is justified as far as i am concerned. jon noring -- charter member --->>> infj club.",

            "koberg, just a couple of minor corrections here... 1) the churches of christ do not usually believe in speaking in tongues, in fact many of them are known for being strongly opposed to pentecostal teaching. you are probably thinking of church of god in christ, the largest african-american pentecostal denomination. 2) i'm not sure what you mean by \"signifying believers\" but it should be pointed out that the assemblies of god does not now, nor has it ever, held that speaking in tongues is the sign that one is a christian. the doctrine that traditional pentecostals (including the a/g) maintain is that speaking in tongues is the sign of a second experience after becoming a christian in which one is \"baptized in the holy spirit\" that may be what you were referring to, but i point this out because pentecostals are frequently labeled as believing that you have to speak in tongues in order to be a christian. such a position is only held by some groups and not the majority of pentecostals. many pentecostals will quote the passage in mark 16 about \"these signs following them that believe\" but they generally do not interpret this as meaning if you don't pactice the signs you aren't \"saved\". 3) i know it's hard to summarize the beliefs of a movement that has such diversity, but i think you've made some pretty big generalizations here. do \"neo-pentecostals\" only believe in tongues as a sign and tongues as prayer but not tongues as revelatory with a message? i've never heard of that before. in fact i would have characterized them as believing the same as pentecostals except less likely to see tongues as a sign of spirit baptism. also, while neo-pentecostals may not be inclined to speak in tongues in the non-pentecostal churches they attend, they do have their own meetings and, in many cases, a whole church will be charismatic.",

(i might be a little off on the title, but he ->writes the book. anyway he was part of an effort to destroy christianity, ->in the process he became a christian himself. sounds like you are saying he was a part of some conspiracy. just what organization did he belong to? does it have a name? -> the book says that jesus was either a liar, or he was crazy ( a ->modern day koresh) or he was actually who he said he was. logic alert - artificial trifercation. the are many other possible explainations. could have been that he never existed. there have been some good points made in this group that is not impossible that jc is an amalgam of a number of different myths, mithra comes to mind. -> some reasons why he wouldn't be a liar are as follows. who would ->die for a lie? wouldn't people be able to tell if he was a liar? people ->gathered around him and kept doing it, many gathered from hearing or seeing ->someone who was or had been healed. call me a fool, but i believe he did ->heal people. logic alert - argument from incredulity. just because it is hard for you to believe this doesn't mean that it isn't true. liars can be very pursuasive, just look at koresh that you yourself site. he has followers that don't think he is a fake and they have shown that they are willing to die. by not giving up after getting shot himself, koresh has shown that he too is will to die for what he believes. as far as healing goes. if i rememer right the healing that was attributed is not consistent between the different gospels. in one of them the healing that is done is not any more that faith healers can pull off today. seems to me that the early gospels weren't that compeling, so the stories got bigger to appeal better. -> niether was he a lunatic. would more than an entire nation be drawn ->to someone who was crazy. very doubtful, in fact rediculous. for example ->anyone who is drawn to david koresh is obviously a fool, logical people see ->this right away. -> therefore since he wasn't a liar or a lunatic, he must have been the ->real thing. or might not have existed, or any number of things. that is the logical pitfall that those who use flawed logic like this fall into. there are bifurcations (or tri, quad, etc) that are valid, because in the proceeding steps, the person shows conclusively that the alternatives are all that are possible. once everyone agrees that the given set is indeed all there are, then arguments among the alternatives can be presentent, and one mostly likely to be true can be deduced by excluding all other possible alternatives. however, if it can be shown that the set is not all inclusive, then any conclusions bases on the incomplete set are invalid, even if the true choice is one of the original choices. i have given at least one valid alternative, so the conclusion that jc is the real mccoy just because he isn't one of the other two alternative is no longer valid. -> some other things to note. he fulfilled loads of prophecies in ->the psalms, isaiah and elsewhere in 24 hrs alone. this in his betrayal ->and crucifixion. i don't have my bible with me at this moment, next time i ->write i will use it. jc was a rabbi. he knew what those prophecies were. it wouldn't be any great shakes to make sure one does a list of actions that would fullfill prophecy. what would be compeling is if there were a set of clear and explicit prophecies and jc had absolutely no knowledge of then, yet fullfilled them anyway. -> i don't think most people understand what a christian is. it ->is certainly not what i see a lot in churches. rather i think it ->should be a way of life, and a total sacrafice of everything for god's ->sake. he loved us enough to die and save us so we should do the ->same. hey we can't do it, god himself inspires us to turn our lives ->over to him. that's tuff and most people don't want to do it, to be a ->real christian would be something for the strong to persevere at. but ->just like weight lifting or guitar playing, drums, whatever it takes ->time. we don't rush it in one day, christianity is your whole life. ->it is not going to church once a week, or helping poor people once in ->a while. we box everything into time units. such as work at this ->time, sports, tv, social life. god is above these boxes and should be ->carried with us into all these boxes that we have created for ->ourselves. here i agree with you. anyone who buys into this load of mythology should take what it says seriously, and what it says is that it must be a total way of life. i have very little respect for xians that don't. if the myth is true, then it is true in its entirity. the picking and choosing that i see a lot of leaves a bad taste in my mouth. jim --- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- james l. felder | sverdrup technology,inc. | phone: 216-891-4019 nasa lewis research center | cleveland, ohio 44135 | email: jfelder@lerc.nasa.gov \"some people drink from the fountain of knowledge, other people gargle\"",
            "in case anyone was wondering about upgrading their 386 or 486 class machine without spending a lot of money, i looked into replacing the processor on those machines and here are the facts (as i understand them). if you have a ps/2 model 70 or model 80, you can replace the i386 chip with either 1) a cyrix 486dlc chip for $130 which will increase your processing power by about 60% for normal fuctions, and not at all for math functions. this chip will only run at your original clock speed, ie. if you have a 16mhz machine the cyrix 486dlc will run at 16mhz. note: windows does not use the math functions, so it is a good upgrade if you are running windows. or, 2) you can get a kingston 486/now platform for $450 with a 25mhz i486sx on it which will increase your normal processing power by about 100%, if you were running at 25mhz originally. but again it will not increase the speed of your math fuctions. i think that it will continue to run at 25mhz even if your original processor runs at a slower speed. there is also 3) the kingston 486/now platform for $750 with a 33mhz i486dx on it. this might speed up your math functions as well, but i am not sure. if you have a ps/2 model 70 b21 or other ps/2 machine with either an i486sx or a non-clock doubling i486dx (ie. it runs at either 25 or 33mhz) in it, then you can get an intel overdrive chip (which is really an i486dx2 chip) and replace your chip with it. you should get about 95% better preformance for both normal and math functions. the 25/50 mhz version of the overdrive chip costs $450 and the 33/66mhz version costs $700. the replacement for the 25mhz 486sx chip is an espeacially good deal as it provides the math coprocessor which the 486sx does not have. note that the speed ratings on the overdrive chips are the maximum speed at which they can run. if you have a 20mhz 486sx, then the overdrive chip will run at 20/40mhz, ie. 20mhz externally and 40mhz internally. there is no reason to buy an overdrive chip which is rated at faster then your machine, you will not get faster performance. you should be able to buy these chips from any of the microchip merchants that advertise at the back of pc magazine or pc week. you might want to shop around as prices do vary. if you need a name/phone number for a source for a particular chip, e-mail me, and i will respond with a couple of sources. lawrence khoo",

            "an excellent idea. while i don't know the full scope of the activities of the eff, from what little i've seen i think it would be better to lobby for strong cryptography through a distinct organization. the eff has been associated with efforts to prevent the banning of sex and pictures newsgroups at various universities. horror stories about the contents of those groups (e.g. exploitative pictures of possibly underaged models) have already surfaced in the press. the white house bulletin already raised the specter of drug-dealing and terrorism, which is only one step removed from the old \"crypto-wielding child molester\" argument. an eff lobbying effort for cryptography would be too easily derailed by the connection to child pornography and the like. similarly, lpf is connected with stallman and his gnu project. in light of, say, the gnu manifesto, this means that in a public debate it stands to be labelled as \"communist\", \"anarchist hackers\", radical, etc. i don't know about cpsr, but if it is an offshoot of physicians for social responsibility (best known for helen caldicott and her hysterical antinuclear lobbying) then it probably also carries unwelcome political baggage. perhaps for practical reasons a lobbying organization for cryptography would best be formed under the umbrella of eff or some other existing group, but its charter should then be distinct, independent, and limited to advocacy for the right to cryptography. to reiterate dan bernstein's question: does any suitable organization exist? if not, what are you going to do about it? having mentioned the possible dangers of unwelcome political associations, i would be remiss not to suggest something in the opposite direction: gathering the support of the nra by emphasizing the rkba side of the issue as well as the first-amendment side.",

            "one of the most popular methods of course is the password check where they ask you for a word from page x, line y, and word z, but this is pitifully simple to remove unless you throw some checksums into the main part of your program, and some self-rewriting code to confuse some people. also, make sure that your program can not be run out a debugger. another method of course is to not even make bad sectors on the original disk, just write a certain key to a certain unallocated sector. to help you here, you also must do the code protection schemes mentioned in the first paragraph. make sure you also fill the rest of the unallocated parts of the disk with garbage as well, or they (wanna be crackers) can just look for the junk in some random sector. like you mentioned, there are the laser holed disks and hardware keys, but they are both expensive and a pain in the butt for the end-user, which you is the opposite of what you want. another configuration that can be used is to save the configuration of the machine that it is being installed to in the most undecipherable format you can think of. if the program does not find that this is the same system, it requests being installed by the original disk again. the original disk should be encrypted, compacted, have many sectors that should be checked, and anything else you can think of to make sure that the original cannot be copied. once again, you must put code-encryption, self-rewriting code, and multiple crc checks in the program to make sure that it does not get changed. among other things, this also protects your program from virii. if the program detects a change in its code, tell the user that a virus has been detected in the program. tell them the program is \"virus secure\", and remember, you have helped the world kill some pirating and kill some viruses. feel good. i hope that i have helped. have fun. knock some cracking out (well, you can't do it, everything that can be written can be cracked, but you'll piss'em off in the process!). goodbye. what is the program that will be sold? -- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- george gruschow death do you gronk. ag625@yfn.ysu.edu ggruscho@nyx.cs.du.edu",

            "the white house office of the press secretary ______________________________________________________________ for immediate release april 15, 1993 remarks by the president to law enforcement organizations the rose garden 2:52 p.m. edt the president: good afternoon. ladies and gentlemen, two months ago i presented a comprehensive plan to reduce our national deficit and to increase our investment in the american people, their jobs and their economic future. the federal budget plan passed congress in record time, and created a new sense of hope and opportunity in the country. then, the short-term jobs plan i presented to congress, which would create a half a million jobs in the next two years passed the house of representatives two weeks ago. it now has the support of a majority of the united states senate. all of these members of congress know it's time to get the economy moving again, to get job growth going again, to get a fast start on the investments we need to build a lasting prosperity. unfortunately, a minority of the members of the united states senate have used gridlock tactics to prevent their colleagues from working the will of the majority on the jobs bill. when congress returns, i ask every senator from every state and from both parties to remember what is at stake. the issue is not politics, it's people. sixteen million of them are looking for full-time jobs and can't find them. these men and women don't care about who's up or down in washington. they care about paying the rent and meeting the mortgage payment, about putting food on the table and buying shoes for their children, about regaining a sense of dignity that comes from doing a day's work and supporting their families and drawing a paycheck. they're asking those of us who have the privilege of serving to put aside politics and do something now to move our economy forward. i am prepared to do that. and i have been working with the senate to come up with an adjusted package that meets some of the concerns of those who have been blocking action on the jobs plan. i'm willing to compromise, so long as we keep the focus on jobs, keep the focus on growth and keep the focus on meeting unmet national needs. our opponents have been asking for a smaller package. today i ask them to join me in determining exactly what kind and what size package congress can approve that actually meets the needs of the american people. but even as we make those reductions and the package will be smaller, i believe we must address problems that are on the minds of millions of americans, and one in particular, and that is the need to toughen law enforcement in our society to deal with the dramatic rise in violent crime. so i will ask, even in this reduced package, for an additional $200 million in federal funding to help local communities to rehire police officers who have been laid off because of the fiscal problems caused by the national recession. together, with a matching effort by local governments, this could put as many as 10,000 police officers back on the job, and back on the beat in communities all across our nation. at a time when too many of our people live in fear of violent crime, when too many businesses have closed and too many people have lost their jobs because people are afraid to leave their homes, rehiring thousands of officers is one of the best investments america can make. and i ask both houses of congress to make that investment in our people's safety and in their piece of mind. i believe in the need for strong federal action to keep the economy going toward recovery and to create jobs. make no mistake about it: i will fight for these priorities as hard as i ever have. i will never forget that the people sent me here to fight for their jobs, their future and for fundamental change. i want to thank the police officers who are here today and tell you that not a single one of them knew before they came here that i had determined to ask for more money in this jobs bill to rehire police officers. they came here because they believe in the summer jobs portion of the package. and i want them to be free to talk about that. they came here not out of any law enforcement concern other than the fact that they wanted the kids in this country to have a chance to have jobs this summer, to have safer streets and a brighter and more peaceful future. i say what i say today not just because it's good for law enforcement but because it's good for the people who live in these communities. i have always supported community policing not only because it helps to prevent crime and to lower the crime rate, but because it cements better relationships between people in law enforcement and the people that they're hired to protect. it reduces the chances of abusive action by police officers and increases the chances of harmony and safe streets at the same time. these are the kinds of things that we are trying to do. i promised in my campaign that i'd do everything i could to put another 100,000 police officers on the street over the next four years. this makes a good downpayment on that. this keeps in mind the core of the jobs package. and this will help us to move forward. so i ask the people in the senate who have blocked the jobs bill, let's work together. i can accept a reduced package if you will increase your commitment to safe streets. i do not accept the fact that we should reduce our commitment to summer jobs or to building our infrastructure or to doing those other things that will create real and lasting prosperity for our people. i have done my part now to end the gridlock; i ask you to do yours. i want now to give the people who are here with me on the platform a chance to make some remarks and to be heard by the american people -- beginning with janet reno, the distinguished attorney general. * * * * * * * * * * * * q mr. president, can you tell us -- do you think that the jobs package could be put in further jeopardy by controversy over the suggestion of a vat tax at this point in the congressional dialogue? the president: not at all. i think it should have -- they wouldn't have any relationship one to the other. first of all, i made absolutely no decision on that. you should know that there's a lot of support in the business community and the labor community -- people have asked us to consider that because of the enormous burden of the present system on many of our major employers, particularly many of those that we depend upon to generate jobs and to carry the strength of this economy. but i have made absolutely no decision that would even approach that on that or any other kind of general tax. q do you personally believe that the american public is ready to pay for -- to have another tax to pay for health care? i mean, apart from what business and labor leaders have said -- the president: i'm not going to speculate on that. i will say this: the real issue is how quickly we can recycle the benefits of all the savings to cover the cost. i mean, that is -- everyone knows that if you do what we're proposing to do, if you streamline the insurance system, if you fix the system so that there's no longer an enormous economic incentive to over-utilize or over-provide certain services, if you provide primary and preventive care in places where it isn't now, every single analysis shows absolutely massive savings to the health care system. the real question is whether you can transfer those savings to cover those who have no coverage now or those who have virtually no coverage so that you provide people the security. i have no idea. the polls say that, but i don't know. all i know is the polls that i see in the press that many of you have commissioned, they say overwhelmingly the american people want the security of an affordable health care system. but i don't think that has anything to do with this stimulus, and it certainly shouldn't have. people want a job first and foremost. they want that more than anything else. q now that you've announced your willingness to compromise on the stimulus package, can you tell us what parts of your package you consider vital and uncompromisable? i assume summer jobs is one. the president: i want the summer jobs; i want the highway program and i want the police program. i still intend -- let me say this: i still intend to fully and aggressively push the crime bill, which did not pass the congress last year. this is a supplement to that, not a substitute for it in any way. but i think we need to do that. i think we need the ryan white funds because of the enormous health care burdens to the communities that are inordinately and disproportionately affected by the problems of caring for people with aids. and there are several other things that i think should be done. we have to do the agriculture department meat inspectors; the safety of the public depends on that. there are a number of other things that i don't -- i don't think any of it should be cut, but i have given senator mitchell and senator byrd -- i talked to them. and senator dole called me yesterday to discuss this, and i told him that i would call him back. i called him back last night in new hampshire and we discussed this. and i basically asked them to talk today, and said that i would not make any statements about any specifics until at least they had a chance to talk to see whether or not they could reach some accord. so i don't want to be any more specific than i have been already, and let's see if they can talk it out. q when you talked to senator dole and senator mitchell did you tell them about your -- increase also, that $200 million, that you want that as part of the package? the president: i did -- i told senator -- i left word for senator mitchell last night about it. when i talked to senator dole -- i don't remember for sure -- i do not believe i mentioned it. but i did tell him that i was prepared to reduce the package and i wanted to break the gridlock, and i told him that i was working on a reformulation of it so that -- in the hope that it would become even more focused on jobs and the kinds of issues that i thought the american people wanted us to address. and this is certainly consistent with that. thank you.",

(not as good as laser master's demo though). i don't know how many other similar products are out there but i would be surprised if there are several.",

(305 pages). (memoirs of an armenian officer who participated in the genocide of 2.5 million muslim people) \"foreword:\" \"for example, we were camped one night in a half-ruined tartar mosque, the most habitable building of a destroyed village, near the border of persia and russian armenia. during the course of evening i asked ohanus if he could tell me anything of the history of the village and the cause of its destruction. in his matter of fact way he replied, yes, i assisted in its sack and destruction, and witnessed the slaying of those whose bones you saw to-day scattered among its ruins.\" p. 202 (first and second paragraphs). \"we closed the roads and mountain passes that might serve as ways of escape for the tartars and then proceeded in the work of extermination. our troops surrounded village after village. little resistance was offered. our artillery knocked the huts into heaps of stone and dust and when the villages became untenable and inhabitants fled from them into fields, bullets and bayonets completed the work. some of the tartars escaped of course. they found refuge in the mountains or succeeded in crossing the border into turkey. the rest were killed. and so it is that the whole length of the borderland of russian armenia from nakhitchevan to akhalkalaki from the hot plains of ararat to the cold mountain plateau of the north were dotted with mute mournful ruins of tartar villages. they are quiet now, those villages, except for howling of wolves and jackals that visit them to paw over the scattered bones of the dead.\" p. 15 (second paragraph). \"the tartars were, for the most part, poor. some of them lived in villages and cultivated small farms; many of them continued in the way of life of their nomadic forefathers. they drove their flocks and herds from valley to valley, from plain to mountain, and from mountain to plain, following the pasturage as it changed with the seasons. they ranged from the salt desert shores of the caspian sea far into the mighty caucasus mountains. even the village tartars are a primitive people, only semicivilized.\" \"i can see now that we armenians frankly despised the tartars, and, while holding a disproportionate share of the wealth of the country, regarded and treated them as inferiors. the fact that the russians looked down upon all armenians in much the same way as armenians regarded tartars, far from proving a bond between ourselves and our racially different neighbors, intensified an attitude and conduct on our part that served only to exacerbate hostility.\" p. 20 (second paragraph). \"our men armed themselves, gathered together and advanced on the tartar section of the village. there were no lights in the houses and the doors were barred, for the tartars suspected what as to happen and were in great fear. our men hammered on the doors, but got no response; whereupon they smashed in the doors and began a carnage that continued until the last tartar was slain. throughout the hideous night, i cowered at home in terror, unable to shut my ears to the piercing screams of the helpless victims and the loud shouts of our men. by morning the work was finished.\" p. 109 (second paragraph). \"as things were, the members of the dashnack party were without administrative experience; consequently the government they instituted quickly proved itself incompetent to rule by legitimate means. the members of the government had been revolutionists working in secret and outside the law. when they became a legally instituted, recognized governing body with the destiny of armenia in their hands, they proved incompetent to do better than resume the terrorist tactics that had characterized their fight against the russian and turkish governments in their outlaw days. the outstanding feature of their rule, now that they were in power, was, as in the old days, trial and execution without hearing. a man evoking the displeasure of the government or of some official would be tried and condemned without arrest or preference of charges against him. the method of execution was for a government 'mauserist' to walk up behind the condemned man in his home or on the street, place a pistol to the back of his head and blow out his brains. this simple way of getting rid of those who were undesirable in the view of the government and soon became a common way of paying debts.\" p. 203 (first paragraph). \"a soldier succeeded in driving his bayonet through the tartar. i saw the point of the weapon emerge through his back. ...another soldier seized a rock and pounded the tartar's head with it... the armenian who had bayoneted him sprang to his feet, wrested the weapon from the tartar's body, and, raising it to his lips, licked it clean of blood, exclaiming in russian, 'slodkey! slodkey!' (sweet.)\" p. 203 (second paragraph). \"one evening i passed through what had been a tartar village. among the ruins a fire was burning. i went to the fire and saw seated about it a group of soldiers. among them were two tartar girls, mere children. the girls were crouched on the ground, crying softly with suppressed sobs. lying scattered over the ground were broken household utensils and other furnishings of tartar peasant homes. there were also bodies of the dead.\" p. 204 (first paragraph). \"i was soon asleep. in the night i was awakened by the persistent crying of a child. i arose and went to investigate. a full moon enabled me to make my way about and revealed to me all the wreck and litter of the tragedy that had been enacted. guided by the child's crying, i entered the yard of a house, which i judged from its appearance must have been the home of a turkish family. there in a corner of the yard i found a women dead. her throat had been cut. lying on her breast was a small child, a girl about a year old.\" p. 118. \"slowly the train of oxcarts lumbered along through the snow, the cart jolting and the loads swaying. boys ran along the line of oxen, encouraging them with shrill tartar cries, and belaboring the beasts with sticks. in the carts, the women, veiled as is the tartar way, held children in their arms. wrapped in blankets and huddled among the goods that burdened the carts they sought protection from the wind and cold. a few old men plodded along on foot. across the road through the ravine a barrier had been thrown. the leading oxteam reached this barrier and halted. the gunmen and other ruffians concealed among the rocks opened fire. women and children leaped and scrambled from the carts, screamed, ran and sought vainly for safety. this massacre was not complete. the armenian soldiers in the near-by barracks, hearing the firing and the turmoil, hurried to the scene.... that same day the abandoned tartar quarter of alexandropol was looted and completely destroyed.\" p. 192. \"great swarms of peasants who had come out of their hiding-places on the retreat of the turks followed our army as it advanced.... they entered into the city with the army and immediately began plundering the stores that had been left by the turks.\" p. 193. \"terrible vengeance was taken upon tartars, kurds and turks. their villages were destroyed and they themselves were slain or driven out of the country.\" p. 195. \"the fanatical dashnacks hated the turks above all others and then in order of diminishing intensity: tartars, kurds and russians.\" p. 218.

            "one not-so-quick question to throw out there for you guys... for our class project, we need to design and build a power supply to the following specs: voltatge: adjustable from 1-12v current: *limited* at 1a voltage must stay within 2% of designated value for i from 0-1a ac ripple less than 5 mv (rms) of course, we can't just use an adjustable voltage, current-limiting regulator chip ;^) our problem is with the current limiting (i.e. we've found stuff to do the rest of the parts of the circuit). what the supply must do, if presented with a load which would draw more than 1a, given the supply voltage, is reduce the voltage so that the current will equal one amp. thus, if we were to short the thing with the ammeter, we should read one amp. if we measure the current through a 1 ohm resistor at 12v, we should read one amp (and the output voltage, by necessity, must be 1v. the only basic idea we have seen for the current limiter involves a circuit which will pull current off of the base of the output power transistor, and therefore reduce the output. so, does anybody have any ideas we could work from? thanks in advance. andy collins, kc6yey acollins@uclink.berkeley.edu",

            "having run completely out of time, i've got to get my prophesies and predictions for the a.l. out. qualifications -- one of the worse finishes in last year's prediction contest. al east -- 1993 1. baltimore orioles why the orioles? well, i pondered long and hard, and it all came down to this: -- the blue jays are going the wrong direction. -- can't bring myself to pick the yankees -- milwaukee was a fluke -- indians aren't ready to contend -- red sox were bad last year, and didn't get any better -- detroit's pitching will be the new definition of \"replacement level\" \"but you don't really think the orioles will win, do you.\" no. as a matter of fact, i can't see any team in the american league winning either division on paper (with the possible exception of the yankees, who i hate). but some- body has to win, so i pick the orioles. \"you don't really think that brady anderson is going to repeat, do you?\" no. i'm basing the orioles prediction on the expectation of big years from cal ripken and glenn davis. \"glenn davis? that's insane\". yes. so, without further ado: strong points: hoiles, ripken some years, olson, getting rid of billy ripken. weak points: segui may start. valenzuela (the original 30-something) may be the fifth starter. oates puts his best hitters at the bottom of the lineup. (does anybody else think that might be a calculated maneuver to minimize the effect of a slumping ripken? if you can't move ripken out of the #3 spot, why not move the rest of the line up?) would be a good sign: glenn davis wins comeback player of the year. would be a bad sign: in a tight pennant race, team trades for pecota. obprediction: \"the streak\" continues. harold reynolds leads the team in caught stealing. 2. new york yankees. strong points: abbot, key, perez. could have best pitching in american league. boggs should improve on hayes. weak points: mattingly still considered best hitter. the steinbrenner factor. (the yankees lost to the mets. can wholesale changes be far behind?) never count on rookie pitchers (i.e. wickman & millitello) to win a division. would be a good sign: boggs hits over .300 would be a bad sign: howe gets arrested again. obprediction: mattingly won't top a 700 ops. 3. toronto blue jays strong points: management willing to make big deals. management has eerie power to convince other teams its prospects are not suspects. olerud. guzman. alomar. weak points: the jackson for bell trade has shaken my faith in gillick. losing stewart may hurt rotation (that's *really* a bad sign). no one in the outfield can get on base. pitching is thin behind guzman and ward. would be a good sign: jack morris considered cy young contender in august would be a bad sign: club makes no major deals in august. obprediction: morris will post better era and whip totals than last year. and have a losing record. 4. milwaukee brewers strong points: pitching staff was exceptional -- last year. weak points: molitor gone. surhoff at third? why? eldred can't keep it up. would be a good sign: listach and eldred play like last year. would be bad sign: bones plays like last year. obprediction: surhoff won't finish the year at third. 5. cleveland indians strong points: baerga, belle, nagy weak points: pitching staff thin -- losing olin really hurts. starts felix fermin. would be a good sign: bielecki's era is consistent with his atlanta starts. would be a bad sign: ted power -- bullpen ace. obprediction: alomar will be back on the dl by the all-star break. 6. boston red sox strong points: clemens, viola, clemens, detroit, clemens weak points: most incompetent gm in baseball. key free agent signing -- andre dawson. burks is gone -- hatcher in center. would be a good sign: rainouts in between clemens starts. would be a bad sign: clemens on the dl obprediction: russell will make sox fans forget reardon. interpret that how you will :-> 7. detroit tigers strong points: tettleton, phillips, whitaker weak points: if fielder keeps declining, he'll be a shortstop this year. worst rotation in baseball entirely replaced -- but not necessarily better. this year could be *very* ugly. would be a good sign: cecil fielder deserving the mvp. would be a bad sign: cecil fielder not whining about deserving an mvp. obprediction: cecil *won't* lead the league in rbis. one more division to go.... -- dale j. stephenson |*| (steph@cs.uiuc.edu) |*| baseball fanatic",

            ". . . why do you assume that jesus's plea to his father \"to let this cup pass from him\", was merely a plea to escape death? when i look at jesus in the garden, i see a man-god, who all his life had had the presense of his father with him. as a result, he knew every detail about his death long before the agony in the garden. but as that hour approached, he felt abandoned by his father, his presense diminishing with each passing minute. in addition, it was brought more and more to jesus's attention (the betrayal of judas was probably a big impact) that his suffering would be to no avail for many people, especially those who would reject him, not only then but in the future. i truly believe that the majority of jesus's suffering was mental and spiritual, while the physical portion was only the tip of the iceburg. btw, we know from john's account that jesus *shunned* becomming an earthly king. from john: joh 6:14 after the people saw the miraculous sign that jesus did, they began to say, \"surely this is the prophet who is to come into the world.\" joh 6:15 jesus, knowing that they intended to come and make him king by force, withdrew again to a mountain by himself. this does not seem like a man who would regret not becoming an earthly king. no, jesus knew his mission was to redeem all (jew & gentile) people and establish his kingdom in the hearts of those who would believe. this was utterly mistaken, much to jesus's dismay, as an aspiration to some earthly kingdom. but he knew what his father's will was and followed it obediently even in the darkness of his passion.",

1. free options the best option is xfree86, which is an enhanced version of x386 1.2. any other version of x386 will have slower performance, and will be more difficult to compile. information on how to obtain xfree86 is listed below. x386 is the port of the x11 server to system v/386 that was done by thomas roell (roell@sgcs.com). it supports a wide variety of svga boards. there are 2 major free versions: x386 1.1 is based on x11r4, x386 1.2 is included in mit's x11r5 distribution (ie. you don't need to patch it into the mit source any more). x386 1.3 is the current commercial offering from sgcs (see below). 2. commercial options 1) metro link 2213 w. mcnab road pompano beach, fl 33069 (305) 970-7353 fax: (305) 970-7351 email: sales@metrolink.com summary: os: qnx, svr3, svr4.[012], sco, unixware, lynxos, desqview/x, venix, isc, solaris, pyramid, sunos hw: ega, vga, svga, tiga, targa, 8514/a, mach, s3, wd, fujistu, matrox, microfield graphics, r33020 other: motif, openlook/xview, xie imaging extension, xv video extension, audio drivers, multi media 2) sgcs (snitily graphics consulting services) 894 brookgrove lane cupertino, ca 95014 (800) 645-5501, (408) 255-9665 fax: (408) 255-9740 email: info@sgcs.com or ...!mips!zok!info summary: os: svr3.2, svr4 hw: 8514/a (ati ultra), s3 (diamond stealth), svga other: motif, dual-headed server 3) consensys corporation 1301 pat booker rd. universal city, tx 78148 phone: 1-800-388-1896 fax: 1-416-940-2903 email: info@consensys.com summary: os: consensys v4.2, consensys' version of unix system v release 4.2 hw: x11r4 server support for vga, svga other: moolit, motif, x11r5 clients 4) the santa cruz operation, inc. p.o. box 1900 santa cruz, california 95061 (408) 425 7222, (800) sco unix, fax: (408) 458 4227 email: info@sco.com summary: os: odt 1.1, odt 2.0, sco unix 3.2v4 hw: x11r4 server support for svga, 8514/a, s3, tms340x0, wd90c31, xga2, assorted local bus (see sco hardware compatabilty guide for actual card vendors). other: motif 5) answer software & consulting p.o. box 14171 columbus, ohio 43214 614-263-xlab email: sales@x4coher.com summary: os: coherent 4.0.1r72 or greater hw: works with any vesa compliant video note: other commercial vendors (including os vendors describing bundled software) are welcome to submit summary information summary information such as the above. ii) what is xfree86 and where do i get it? 3. what is xfree86? xfree86 is an enhanced version of x386 1.2, which was distributed with x11r5. this release consists of many bug fixes, speed improvements, and other enhancements. here are the highlights of the enhancements: 1) the speedup package from glenn lai is an integral part of xfree86, selectable at run-time via the xconfig file. some speedups require an et4000 based svga, and others require a virtual screen width of 1024. the speedups suitable to the configuration are selected by default. with a high-quality et4000 board (vram), this can yield up to 40% improvement of the xstones benchmark over x386 1.2. 2) the fx386 packages from jim tsillas are included as the default operating mode if speedup is not selected. this mode is now equivalent in performance to x386 1.1b (x11r4), and approximately 20% faster than x386 1.2. 3) support for localconn, compile-time selectable for server, clients, or both. this support is for both svr3.2 and svr4. for svr4.0.4 with the 'advanced compatibility package', local connections from sco xsight/odt clients are supported. 4) drivers for ati and trident tvga8900c and tvga9000 svga chipsets. refer to the files readme.ati and readme.trident for details about the ati and trident drivers. 5) support for compressed bitmap fonts has been added (thomas eberhardt's code from the contrib directory on export.lcs.mit.edu). 6) type1 font code from mit contrib tape has been included, and is compile-time selectable. there are contributed type1 fonts in the contrib directory on export.lcs.mit.edu. 7) new configuration method which allows the server's drivers and font renderers to be reconfigured from both source and binary distributions. 8) integrated support for 386bsd, mach, and linux. 9) a monochrome version of the server which will run on generic vga cards is now included. the following key features were added with the release of xfree86 1.2 (they were not in xfree86 1.1): 1) the monochrome server has been enhanced to do bank-switching of available svga memory to allow virtual screens up to 1600x1200 (see the x386(1) manual page for more information). 2) support for the hercules mono card has been added to the monochrome server, and with it the ability to support a \"two headed\" server - one vga, and one hercules. so far this has only been tested on svr4 (it is also reported to work under linux). 3) svr3 shared libraries, tested under isc svr3 2.2 and 3.0.1. 4) support for svr4.2 (there are some special considerations to consider, due to new usl bugs; see the readme.svr4 file for more information.) 5) support for ps/2 mice, and logitech mouseman/trackman (some versions of these devices were not previously compatible). 6) a new tutorial on how to develop correct video card and monitor timing data, written by eric raymond (derived from previous documentation and a lot of experimentation). 7) greatly improved support for international keyboards, including implementation of the compose key functionality found on many vendor servers (see the x386keybd(1) manual page for more information). 8) the accuracy with which the server detects svga pixel clocks has been improved, and the timings are now stored at accuracies of 0.1 mhz. users may want to consider removing an existing clocks line from their xconfig file and re-probing using the new server. 9) many enhancements in error handling and parsing of the xconfig configuration file. error messages are much more informative and intuitive, and more validation is done. there are many new options that can be enabled in the xconfig file (see the x386(1) manual page for more information on the format of this file). plus a number of other small things. refer to the changelog file in the source distribution for full details. also included are a tutorial on monitor timing by eric raymond, and the current x386 mode database and a sample xdm configuration by david wexelblat. 4. what oss are supported? xfree86 supports: svr4.2: consensys v4.2 svr4.0: microport, dell, esix, isc, at&t, mst, consensys, uhc svr3: isc 2.2 & 3.0, at&t 2.2 linux, mach 386, 386bsd 0.1 bsd/386 is not supported, but it should work. the most active bsd/386 person is greg lehey <grog@lemis.de>. note that esix 3.2d and sco are not supported yet, but anyone should feel free to submit patches. if you are interested in tackling this, send mail to xfree86@physics.su.oz.au 5. what video hardware is supported? at this time, xfree86 1.2 supports the following svga chipsets: tseng et4000 tseng et3000 paradise pvga1 western digital wd90c00, wd90c10, wd90c11 (these are supersets of the pvga1, and use its driver) genoa gvga trident tvga8900c, tvga9000 ati 18800, 28800 all of the above are supported in both 256 color and monochrome modes, with the exception of the ati chipsets, which are only supported in 256 color mode. the monochrome server also supports generic vga cards, using 64k of video memory in a single bank, and the hercules card. on the et3000, only 64k of video memory is supported for the monochrome server, and the gvga has not been tested with more than 64k. it appears that some of the svga card manufacturers are going to non-traditional mechanisms for selecting pixel-clock frequencies. to avoid having to modify the server to accommodate these schemes xfree86 1.2 adds support for using an external program to select the pixel clock. this allows programs to be written as new mechanisms are discovered. refer to the readme.clkprog file for information on how these programs work, if you need to write one. if you do develop such a program, the xfree86 team would be interested in including it with future xfree86 releases. if you are purchasing new hardware for the purpose of using xfree86, it is suggested that you purchase an et4000-based board such as the orchid prodesigner iis. avoid recent diamond boards; xfree86 will not work with them, because diamond won't provide programming details. in fact, the xfree86 project is actively not supporting new diamond products, as long as such policies remain in effect. contributions of code will not be accepted (because of the potential liabilities). if you would like to see this change, tell diamond about it. some people have asked if xfree86 would work with local bus or eisa video cards. theoretically, the means of communication between the cpu and the video card is irrelevant to xfree86 compatibility. it could be isa, eisa, or local bus. what should matter is the chipset on the video card. unfortunately, the developers don't have a lot of access to eisa or vlb machines, so this is largely an untested theory. however, we have yet to see any reports of things not working on one of these buses and we have several reports of xfree86 working fine on them. 6. what about accelerated boards? at this time, there is no support in xfree86 for accelerated boards like the s3, ati ultra (8514/a), tiga, etc. this support is available in commercial products from sgcs and metrolink (for svr3 and svr4). an s3 server is available for 386bsd and linux. contact <hasty@netcom.com> for 386bsd or <jon@robots.ox.ac.uk> for linux. a beta 8514/a server is available for linux. contact <martin@cs.unc.edu> or <jon@robots.ox.ac.uk>. note: these servers are not part of xfree86. 7. why doesn't xfree86 support 16-color vga modes? the reason that this is not supported is the way vga implements the 16-color modes. in 256-color modes, each byte of frame buffer memory contains 1 pixel. but the 16-color modes are implemented as bit- planes. each byte of frame- buffer memory contains 1 bit from each of each of 8 pixels, and there are four such planes. the mit frame- buffer code is not designed to deal with this. if vga handled 16-color modes by packing 2 4-bit pixels into each byte, the mit code could be modified to support this (or it already may; i'm not sure). but for the vga way of doing things, a complete new frame-buffer implementation is required. some beta testers are looking into this, but nothing is yet available from the project. 8. what other hardware or software requirements are there? obviously, a supported svga board and os are required. to run x efficiently, 12-16mb of memory should be considered a minimum. the various binary releases take 10-40mb of disk space, depending on the os (e.g. whether or not it supports shared libraries). to build from sources, at least 80mb of free disk space will be required, although 120mb should be considered a comfortable lower bound. 9. where can i get source for xfree86? source patches for the current version (1.2, based on x11r5 pl22 from mit), are available via anonymous ftp from: export.lcs.mit.edu (under /contrib/xfree86) ftp.physics.su.oz.au (under /xfree86) ftp.win.tue.nl (under /pub/xfree86) (for the rest of this faq, these 3 location will be called $ftp) refer to the readme file under the specified directory for information on which files you need to get to build your distribution. 10. where can i get binaries for xfree86? binaries are available via anonymous ftp from: ftp.physics.su.oz.au - svr4 binaries under /xfree86/svr4 ftp.win.tue.nl - svr4 binaries under /pub/xfree86/svr4 ferkel.ucsb.edu - svr4 binaries under /pub/svr4/xfree86 stasi.bradley.edu - svr4 binaries under /pub/xfree86/svr4 blancmange.ma.utexas.edu - svr3 (isc) binaries under /pub/isc ftp.prz.tu-berlin.de - svr3 (isc) binaries under /pub/pc/isc/xfree86 tsx-11.mit.edu - linux binaries under /pub/linux/packages/x11 agate.berkeley.edu - 386bsd binaries under /pub/386bsd/0.1-ports/xfree86 ftp.cs.uwm.edu - mach binaries under /i386 ensure that you are getting xfree86 1.2 - some of these sites may archive older releases as well. each binary distribution will contain a readme file that describes what files you need to take from the archive, and which compile-time option selections were made when building the distribution. iv) what general things should i know about running xfree86? 11. installation directories the top-level installation directory is specified by the projectroot (/usr/x386, by default) variable in config/site.def. binaries, include files, and libraries are installed in $projectroot/{bin,include,lib}. this can be changed when rebuilding from sources, and can be modified via symbolic links for those oss that support them. this directory is nonstandard, and was chosen this way to allow xfree86 to be installed alongside a commercial/vendor-supplied x implementation. 12. configuration files the xfree86 server reads a configuration file (\"xconfig\") on startup. the search path, contents and syntax for this file are documented in the server manpage, which should be consulted before asking questions. 13. determining vga dot clocks and monitor modes david e wexelblat (dwex@mtgzfs3.att.com) maintains a database of known clock settings for vga cards and monitor settings. the database is installed in /usr/x386/lib/x11/etc/modedb.txt, and is in the source tree under mit/server/ddx/x386/etc. this database is also available from him (for the latest copy), and is kept on export.lcs.mit.edu in ~/contrib/x386.modedb.z, which is updated occasionally. obtain a copy of this database. it just might have the settings you need. if you create new settings, please send them to david for inclusion in the database. if this doesn't help you, the videomodes.doc (by eric raymond) file with xfree86 contains tutorials on how to come up with these timings. it may be helpful to start with settings that almost work, and use this description to get them right. when you do, send the information to david wexelblat for inclusion in the database. note: the old 'clock.exe' program is not supported any more, and is completely unnecessary. if you need to determine dot clock values for a new board, remove the 'clocks' line from your xconfig file (if present), and start the server. the server will probe for clocks itself and print them out. you can use these values to put a 'clocks' line into your xconfig file, which is not necessary, but will speed up starting the server in the future. 14. rebuilding/reconfiguring the server from the link kit if you have installed the server binary link kit, it is possible to reconfigure the drivers and font renderers in the server. this is fully explained in the readme file that is available with the link kit. v) what os-specific things should i know about running xfree86? first of all, the server must be installed suid-root (mode 4755). 15. svr4 why won't my xterm run properly? if your kernel is not built with the consem module, you should define consem=no in you environment. otherwise xterm won't run. csh users should use 'setenv consem no' the esix console driver patch 403019 is known to cause keymapping problems with xfree86. it recommended that this patch not be installed. alternatively they keymap can be fixed with xmodmap. 16. svr3 make sure you look at $ftp/readme.isc, if that's what you are running. 17. 386bsd make sure you look at $ftp/readme.386bsd. also, a separate 386bsd faq is maintained by richard murphey <rich@rice.edu>. the latest version should be available in the file xfree86-1.2-386bsd-faq at the following ftp sites: agate.berkeley.edu:/pub/386bsd/0.1-ports/xfree86-1.2 wuarchive.wustl.edu:/mirrors4/386bsd/0.1-ports/xfree86-1.2 grasp1.univ-lyon1.fr:pub/386bsd/0.1-ports/xfree86-1.2 18. linux you must be running linux 0.97pl4 or greater, and have the 4.1 gcc jump libraries installed. make sure the binaries x386, x386mono, xload and xterm are setuid root. if your kernel doesn't have tcp support compiled in, you'll have to run the server as \"x -pn\". the default startup configuration assumes that tcp is not available. if it is, change the two files /usr/x386/bin/startx and /usr/x386/lib/x11/xdm/xservers, removing the -pn argument to x386. make sure /dev/console is either a link to /dev/tty0 or has the major number 4, minor number 0. also note that if /dev/console is not owned by the user running x, then xconsole and xterm will not permit console output redirection. xdm will properly change the owner, but startx won't. when running xdm from rc.local, you will need to provide it with a tty, for example \"xdm < /dev/console &\". for more detailed information, please read the file readme present with the distribution on tsx-11.mit.edu. 19. mach make sure you look at $ftp/readme.mach. vi) what things should i know for building xfree86 from source? this section has been removed from the faq, since it is fully explained in $ftp/readme and the os-specific readmes. please look at those files for information on building xfree86. vii) is there anything special about building clients with xfree86? 20. bsd compatibility library a lot of clients make use of bsd functions like bcopy(), etc. the default configuration files are set up to link with libxbsd.a which contains emulation for bcopy(), bzero(), bcmp(), ffs(), random(), seed(). a better way of providing the 'b' functions is to include <x11/xfuncs.h> in source files that call them. xfuncs.h provides macro definitions for these in terms of the sysv 'mem' functions. if you are linking with a vendor supplied library which calls some of these functions, then you should link with libxbsd.a 21. ansiccoptions this is something that was added to allow a developer to get rid of the ansi-ness defined in the default ccoptions without having to rewrite the entire ccoptions line. for example, with stock mit, you'd see something like ccoptions=\"-ansi -o2 -fwritable-strings\" and to get rid of the ansi-ness, the developer would have to put ccoptions=\"-o2 -fwritable-strings\" in his imakefile. with this change, you would see a default of ansiccoptions=\"-ansi\" ccoptions=\"-o2 -fwritable-strings\" and all the developer would have to put in the imakefile is: ansiccoptions= to get rid of the ansi-ness (many x clients will die a horrible death with -ansi). the effect is even more dramatic in practice, because ccoptions is actually quite complex. the other issue is that one must add 'ansiccoptions=$(ansiccoptions)' to a passcdebugflags definition. xfree86 contact information ongoing development planning and support is coordinated by the xfree86 core team. at this time the core team consists of: the original \"gang of four\": david dawes <dawes@physics.su.oz.au> glenn lai <glenn@cs.utexas.edu> jim tsillas <jtsilla@damon.ccs.northeastern.edu> david wexelblat <dwex@mtgzfs3.att.com> those supporting non-sysv operating systems: robert baron <robert.baron@ernst.mach.cs.cmu.edu> [mach] rich murphey <rich@rice.edu> [386bsd] orest zborowski <obz@kodak.com> [linux] e-mail sent to <xfree86@physics.su.oz.au> will reach all of the core team. -------------------------------------------------- thanks to all the people who already sent me corrections or additions, especially david wexelblat (one of the major contributors of updates).",

            "perhaps we have different definitions of absolute then. to me, an absolute is something that is constant across time, culture, situations, etc. true in every instance possible. do you agree with this definition? i think you do: a simple example: in the new testament (sorry i don't have a bible at work, and can't provide a reference), women are instructed to be silent and cover their heads in church. now, this is scripture. by your definition, this is truth and therefore absolute. do women in your church speak? do they cover their heads? if all scripture is absolute truth, it seems to me that women speaking in and coming to church with bare heads should be intolerable to evangelicals. yet, clearly, women do speak in evangelical churches and come with bare heads. (at least this was the case in the evangelical churches i grew up in.) evangelicals are clearly not taking this particular part of scripture to be absolute truth. (and there are plenty of other examples.) can you reconcile this? i don't claim that there are *no* absolutes. i think there are very few, though, and determining absolutes is difficult. but you are claiming that all of scripture is absolute. how can you determine absolutes derived from scripture when you can't agree how to interpret the scripture? it's very difficult to see how you can claim something which is based on your own *interpretation* is absolute. do you deny that your own background, education, prejudices, etc. come into play when you read the bible, and determine how to interpret a passsage? do you deny that you in fact interpret?",

            "(moderator: this is a replacement for an earlier, more clumsily worded submission on the same topic which i submitted a few minutes ago.) i think we need to distinguish etymology from meaning. regardless of how the word 'easter' *originated*, the fact is that it does not *now* mean anything to christians other than 'the feast day of the resurrection of jesus christ'. the meaning of a word is _only_ what people understand it to mean. and the same goes for other cultural practices. the festival of easter may possibly have some historical association with some pagan festival, but *today* there are, as far as i know, no christians who *intend* to honor any kind of \"pagan goddess\" by celebrating easter. it is nonsense to say \"this word (or this practice) 'really' means so- and-so even though nobody realizes it.\" words and practices don't mean things, people do.

(i suspect that this letter would eliminate their being able to claim prior damage to the helmet in the event i were to sue them.) the bottom line, though, is that it appears that a helmets integrity can be compromised with no visible signs. the only way to know for sure is to send it back and have it inspected. note that some helmet manufacturers provide inspections services and some do not. another point to consider when purchasing a lid.",

(i'm suspicious of hard drive caches especially when they cache data writing.) the straightforward approach would be to run chkdsk with the /f option to fix the disk and then it looks like i would probably have to reinstall windows and a few other things. thanks for your comments and suggestions. brad banko ps: this is a 386sx machine with a 40mb hard drive and 2 mb of ram. chkdsk output: ====================================================================== volume serial number is 1159-09d3 errors found, f parameter not specified corrections will not be written to disk c:\\gfx\\vpic46\\cvpic.exe allocation error, size adjusted c:\\gfx\\vpic46\\vpic.txt allocation error, size adjusted c:\\gfx\\vpic46\\video7.cfg allocation error, size adjusted c:\\gfx\\vpic46\\orcpro2.cfg allocation error, size adjusted c:\\gfx\\vpic46\\vga.cfg allocation error, size adjusted c:\\game\\goose\\bird2.x allocation error, size adjusted c:\\winmisc\\adv21\\winadv.exe allocation error, size adjusted 316 lost allocation units found in 224 chains. 647168 bytes disk space would be freed c:\\gfx\\vpic46\\cvpic.exe is cross linked on allocation unit 16133 c:\\gfx\\vpic46\\geno5400.cfg is cross linked on allocation unit 16138 c:\\gfx\\vpic46\\tri8800b.cfg is cross linked on allocation unit 16139 c:\\gfx\\vpic46\\ts4000hi.cfg is cross linked on allocation unit 16140 c:\\gfx\\vpic46\\config.doc is cross linked on allocation unit 16141 c:\\gfx\\vpic46\\vpic.txt is cross linked on allocation unit 16146 c:\\gfx\\vpic46\\video7.cfg is cross linked on allocation unit 16151 c:\\gfx\\vpic46\\defincon.cfg is cross linked on allocation unit 16152 c:\\gfx\\vpic46\\atiwondr.cfg is cross linked on allocation unit 16153 c:\\gfx\\vpic46\\geno6400.cfg is cross linked on allocation unit 16154 c:\\gfx\\vpic46\\oak.cfg is cross linked on allocation unit 16155 c:\\gfx\\vpic46\\hires.cfg is cross linked on allocation unit 16156 c:\\gfx\\vpic46\\aheada.cfg is cross linked on allocation unit 16157 c:\\gfx\\vpic46\\vpic.doc is cross linked on allocation unit 16208 c:\\gfx\\vpic46\\orcpro2.cfg is cross linked on allocation unit 16184 c:\\gfx\\vpic46\\everx673.cfg is cross linked on allocation unit 16185 c:\\gfx\\vpic46\\wait.com is cross linked on allocation unit 16186 c:\\gfx\\vpic46\\maxxon.cfg is cross linked on allocation unit 16187 c:\\gfx\\vpic46\\wait.doc is cross linked on allocation unit 16188 c:\\gfx\\vpic46\\everx678.cfg is cross linked on allocation unit 16189 c:\\gfx\\vpic46\\ega.cfg is cross linked on allocation unit 16190 c:\\gfx\\vpic46\\config.exe is cross linked on allocation unit 16191 c:\\gfx\\vpic46\\readme.1st is cross linked on allocation unit 16199 c:\\gfx\\vpic46\\vga.cfg is cross linked on allocation unit 16201 c:\\game\\goose\\bird2.x is cross linked on allocation unit 16382 c:\\windows\\system\\sound.drv is cross linked on allocation unit 16380 c:\\windows\\games0.grp is cross linked on allocation unit 16367 c:\\windows\\mad79-11.bmp is cross linked on allocation unit 16341 c:\\mage\\demo2_2a.kin is cross linked on allocation unit 16151 c:\\mage\\demo2_2b.kin is cross linked on allocation unit 16257 c:\\mage\\pkin_2_2.exe is cross linked on allocation unit 16339 c:\\winmisc\\games\\dialword.exe is cross linked on allocation unit 16184 c:\\winmisc\\games\\dialword.txt is cross linked on allocation unit 16201 c:\\winmisc\\adv21\\winadv.wri is cross linked on allocation unit 16257 c:\\winmisc\\adv21\\adv.key is cross linked on allocation unit 16265 c:\\winmisc\\adv21\\adv.rec is cross linked on allocation unit 16275 c:\\winmisc\\adv21\\freezer is cross linked on allocation unit 16339 c:\\386spart.par is cross linked on allocation unit 16133 c:\\bng2.mbx is cross linked on allocation unit 16146 42366976 bytes total disk space 3958784 bytes in 4 hidden files 153600 bytes in 67 directories 36042752 bytes in 1496 user files 1564672 bytes available on disk 2048 bytes in each allocation unit 20687 total allocation units on disk 764 available allocation units on disk 655360 total bytes memory 579712 bytes free",

[more deleted] do you think this is what christianity is all about? not all christians believe in this particular story literally. it sounds above like you are supporting a policy of \"to each his own\" -- here is another example of that. if it helps someone's faith to take every word of the bible literally, i support and respect that, too. please don't judge all of christianity by one man. the only man one can truly judge all of christianity by is jesus (makes sense, right?). i think his point about how we put our lives into little boxes is very true -- what does your comment about robertson have to do with that? i was raised agnostic -- my father was never baptised and was raised atheist. he is not an atheist because he found a close-mindedness present in the viewpoint of his parents equal to the close-mindedness he found in the viewpoint of the christians he came in contact with. thus i was _free_ to choose how to live my life, and he supported the decision i made to join the episcopal church, although he emphasized to me that his respect for my beliefs should result in my not intruding on his beliefs, ie, i should not try to convert him, as that is his decision. (please, no flames or advice on how to convert him!) one of my good friends is hindi and i greatly respect her beliefs and the culture surrounding her religion. my best friend is jewish and i have always held a profound resepct for the jewish religion (chaim potok and isaac bashevis singer are two of my favorite authors). i really do not think you can make that kind of generalization about how christians choose -- and i do mean choose-- their faith. if they have not consciously accepted the faith in their adult lives (which is what confirmation represents), then you can talk about their being brainwashed.",

(i did run a bbs some time ago, but that was in switzerland) the us doesn't yet have many laws covering bbss - they're not common carriers, they're not phone companies, they're just private machines or services operated by businesses. there's no obligation to keep records. as perry metzger points out, if the police come with a search warrant, you have to let them see what the warrant demands, if it exists, and they generally can confiscate the equipment as \"evidence\" (which is not constitutionally valid, but we're only beginning to develop court cases supporting us). a court may be able to compel you to tell them information you know, such as the encryption password for the disk - there aren't any definitive cases yet, since it's a new situation, and there probably aren't laws specifically covering it. but the court can't force you to *know* the keys, and there are no laws preventing you from allowing your users to have their own keys for their own files without giving them to you. even in areas that do have established law, there is uncertainty. there was a guy in idaho a few years ago who had his business records subpoenaed as evidence for taxes or some other business-restriction law, so he gave the court the records. which were in hebrew. the us doesn't have laws forcing you to keep your records in english, and these were the originals of the records. he didn't speak hebrew, and neither did anybody in the court organization. don't think they were able to do much about it. it might be illegal for your bbs to deny access to potential customers based on race, religion, national origin, gender, or sexual preference; it probably hasn't been tested in court, but it seems like a plausible extension of anti-discrimination laws affecting other businesses.",

            "dear fellow christians, i had a dinner last night with a bible study group which i am in. we had a discussion about the difference between christianity and islam. and i was shocked to hear that our bible study teacher said that mohammad was indeed a prophet but of satan. i said, \"what??\" i did not believe that, because i have some moslem friends who are so kind and nice, even sometimes i feel i wish i could be like them (in my point of view, they don't sin as much as i do). how come if they were under satan, they could have such personalities. to tell you the truth, i don't know much about islam. but i know that they believe in god, they believe in the day of judgement. now i'm asking you what your opinions about islam and its teaching. important : i do not want to discuss whether they are saved or not. i do not want to discuss about politic related to islam. p.s: i post this in bit.listserv.christia, soc.religion.christian, and bit.listserv.catholic. in christ, our lord, smile......... jesus loves you....... tabut torsina torsina@enuxhb.eas.asu.edu [let me start by saying that this is not the right newsgroup for a discussion of islam, since there's a group for that. but i suspect the point your teacher was making was not specifically about islam. indeed it's going to be impossible to see what he was getting at within your groundrules, since the question of whether non-christians are saved is at the heart of it. the classic christian view, which i think most people believed until the last century or so, was that christianity (and of course judaism) was the only religion founded by god, and that all other religions worshipped false gods, and came from satan. this is more or less a corollary of another traditional view that no one but christians (and possibly jews) will be saved. this need not mean that there's no truth in any other religion, nor that all of their members are intentionally satanic. after all, in order to be an effective snare, satanic alternatives would have to be attractive. thus they might contain all kinds of truth, wisdom and spiritual insights. they would be missing only one thing -- knowledge of salvation through christ. if this is the background of your teacher's remarks -- and i suspect it is -- that means that a discussion of islam is not necessarily relevant. the point is not that there's anything intrinsically wrong with it. it may teach a fine code of behavior, and its practitioners may all be wonderful people. but if salvation requires being a follower of christ, it could still be a satanic invention. this is a reasonable deduction from the classic protestant position. christianity says that salvation isn't a matter of being kind and nice. those are good things, and we should encourage them. but no one is able to do them enough to be saved. salvation requires christ. (please forgive me for doing this in protestant terms. there's a catholic equivalent to this that has similar implications, but in different terms.) a religion may be quite attractive in all visible ways. but if it doesn't have christ, it's like a diet that consists of food that looks wonderful, tastes great, but is missing some essential food element so that you end up dying. let me be clear that i am not specifically advocating this position. what i'm trying to do is (as usual) to clarify issues. indeed it is now relatively uncommon for christians to believe that all other religions are satanic. most christians regard such beliefs as an unfortunate vestige of the past. this is part of a general move within christianity in the last century or so to a non-judgemental god. christians now find it hard to believe that god would allow anybody other than a really rotten person to end up in hell, and they find it hard to envision that real malignant spiritual forces are at work in the world doing things like creating superficially attractive alternatives to christianity. whether there is actually a sound basis for the shift is a decision that people need to make for themselves.",

            "the bible does tell us that governments are ordained by god (romans 13). and furthermore, god foreknows everything that would happen. it is just to difficult for humans to graps with our limited minds, the inevitablity of the sucess of god's plan, and this is especially hard to grasp when we see governemnts doing evil. however, though they are doing evil (and we should not cooperate with them when they do such), it must be understood that what happens is what god wanted so as to lead to the final sucess of his plan to save as many souls from hell as is possible. in short, the slaughter in bosnia, though deplorable in the eyes of god (maybe, then again, they might be getting their just deserts now rather than later; there are plenty of examples of god killing people for their sins - onan in the old testmament for example, and annias and spahira in the new) is what he willed to happen so that his plan might be accomplished. but don't forget, it is not unbiblical for god to use one nation to execute his just judgement upon another. the romans were used to fulfill the chorus of \"let his blood be upon our hands\" of the crowd in jersualem. and chaldea was chastised by babylon, which got israel, which was inturn gotten by persia, etc. god does use nations to punish other nations, as the bible very clearly shows in the old testament. don't you remember the words of god recorded in daniel, \"mene, mene, tekel, peres?\" babylon had been weighed in the balance scales of god's justice, found severly wanting, and was thus given over to the persians as their due punishment for their rebellion. another exammple is the extirmination of the cannanites, ordered by god as the task of israel. the cannanites had been given their chance, found severly wanting, and the great judge, carried out his just sentence accrodingly. i could go on with more examples, but i see little need to do so, as my point is quite clear. two things need to be remembered at all times. 1) it is not up to us to question why god has ordered the world as he has. in his divine wisdom, he made the world as was best in his eyes, and like paul says in romans 9, the clay is not one to tlak back to the potter. 2) the message of jesus christ is as follows: \"repent now, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.\" jesus christ did not allow any time for dilly-dallying - \"let the dead bury the dead, come, follow me.\" there is not an infinite amount of time, rather christ is passing by right now, calling people to follow him and become fishers of men. he does not say, \"well, alright, you can call me back in a week and see if my kingdom fits in with your plans.\" he said \"follow me.\" his message is not \"i'm just a sweety-pie who would never hurt a fly, you've got all the time in the world, and divine judgement, that's only a fairy tale.\" \"our great god and savior\" jesus christ (titus 2.5) is also the just and righteous judge of the world. and it is not up to the defendants in the trial to be questioning his entirely just sentences of either chastisement or mercy.",

            "i've been using final from coda for some time, but suddenly it stopped using my fonts. i have a 386 pc with lots of disk space and memory, a postscript laser, win3.1, finale 2.0.1 and i recently installed atm 2.0. i've been fiddling around with the windows setup for some time, and when i needed to do some work with finale things didn't print properly. it might - and it might not - have anything to do with the installation of atm from 1.something to 2.0, but i don't have the old atm lying around anomore. the most annoying problem was that the petrucci font didn't print, which is a rather important font :-) i managed to get direct printing to work if i included ownps=0 in the [finale] section of win.ini, but compile postscript listing still doesn't work; and it's those .eps files i need. when i look at the .eps files generated the only font which appears there is courier. i found out that if i manually changed the courier 24-point to petrucci 24-point in the .eps file everything worked ok, but i'd rather avoid that since i have a lot of songs to work with. and yes, in the special/font/font names dialog box all the fonts i need are listed, with the correct mapping between finale, screen and printer fonts. finale is obviously aware of the fonts since direct printing of a score works well (that is, after i included ownps=0), and all my other windows applications print petrucci and the other fonts well. has anyone encountered problems like this? what is the current version of finale from coda music software? i have 2.0.1 are the people at coda available on internet or x.400? i'd be grateful for all hints and help. -mats",

            "john 12:24-26: \"most assuredly, i say to you, unless a grain of wheat falls onto the ground and dies, it remains alone; but if it dies, it produces much grain. \"he who loves his life will lose it, and he who hates his life in this world will keep it for eternal life. \"if anyone serves me, let him follow me; and where i am, there my servant will be also. if anyone serves me, him my father will honor.\" why would i want an eternal life if i hate this one? if we were created by a deity, why would that deity not wish us to enjoy what he has given us? why would i want to live forever? the challenge in my life is that i will die, and that i must give my life the meaning i wish it to have before that happens. my time is here and will someday pass; i will be content to live on in the memories of my friends, and once they too are dead, then i will no longer have any reason to exist. in short: even if your deity *does* exist, that doesn't automatically mean that i would worship it. i am content to live my own life, and fend for myself, so when i die, i can be proud of the fact that no matter where i end up, it will be because of *my* actions and *my* choices. if your god decides to toss me into a flaming pit for this, then so be it. i would much rather just cease to exist. but if your god wants my respect and my obedience, then it had better earn these; and if it does, then they will be very strong and true. jesus wasn't the only one who rose from the dead -- i think it was osiris who did the same, as well as a few characters from greek or norse legend, if memory serves. but still: why would i want to rise from the dead? why do *you* want to? if your god wants to win my devotion, then it knows what it can do -- provide some way for me to believe without having to resort to blind faith that could be applied equally well to any religion. that's precisely it. i neither see nor know zeus either, nor odin. shall i offer them the same devotion i offer jesus? you've got to understand my point-of-view: i see christians spouting bible verse all the time as if it were some sort of magic spell that will level all opposition. truth is, it's not. robert has never demonstrated that he actually understands what the verses imply; he just rattles them off day by day. some brazenly fly in the face of common sense and reality, and i point these out where i can. but even more than that, even when christians *do* try to explain the verses in their own words, they do so from a christian point of view, which is that every human being would want to be a christian if only he or she understood the christian message properly, and then all strife and suffering on the earth would end. here's the problem with that: substitute \"moslem\" or \"buddhist\" or \"satanist\" instead of \"christian\", and it means the same thing. christanity is a very nice belief set around a very nice book. but if you want to make me believe that it has any bearing on the real world, you've got some convincing to do. and in my opinion, you're bumbling about blindly making up entities where there aren't any, and depriving yourself of a true understanding and enjoyment of your life. as long as you keep your beliefs to yourself, i'll keep my beliefs to myself -- but as soon as you start waving them around, expect me to toss in my opinions, too.",
            "i don't know much about computers, so please bear with me. here's my question: context: i use a package called slip on my home computer to connect to the university mainframe (an ibm 3090 running vms/mvs), and log on to my account. when i installed slip on my computer, i had to configure it for my modem (14.4 kbs etronics internal) and had to supply the phone number to dial to reach the mainframe. the way it works now is that i type \"telnet uicvm\" or \"tn3270 uicvm\" (either will work) at the dos prompt. uicvm is the node name of the mainframe. the program then dials the mainframe, establishes a protocol, and gives me the logon screen. \"telnet\" and \"tn3270\" are the names of batch files in my slip directory. i have been told that a kermit protocol is used for the session. problem: i would like to be able to do all this under windows 3.1 because i hardly ever use dos directly. slip will not run under windows. i talked to the people at our computer center, and they suggested that i use a packet driver called winpkt.com with slip. they gave me instructions on how to load it before i start windows, and how to modify the tcpstart and tcpstop batch files (in the slip directory) to ensure that it would work. i did all that and i could run slip from windows, but there were other problems. for one thing, slip would not hang up the phone when i exited. i had to run my communi- cations program to hang up the phone or reboot the computer when that didn't work. for another, there were too many errors. it often took me 3-4 tries to connect to the mainframe. our computer center does not support slip under windows, so i can't keep going back to them with more questions. question: is there some other shareware package that will run under windows and do what slip is supposed to do? i need a package that is not too expensive, which is why i am looking for shareware. i have heard that there are regular commercial packages that do all this, but they cost hundreds of dollars. these are the main requirements: 1. must be able to run under windows 3.1 2. must allow vt100 and ibm tn3270 terminal emulation 3. must allow ftp file transfers, since that's the only kind the mainframe allows. no y-modem or z-modem etc. i believe the ftp transfers are made through a kermit protocol, but i'm hazy about that. a subsidiary feature (that would be nice to have) if it's a true windows program (rather than a dos program modified to run under windows) is the ability to run the session in a window concurrently with other applications and to cut and paste between the telnet session and other applications. any information received is appreciated.",

            "i apologize to the moderator, but the first quote was deleted and i would like to respond to both. as for the \"goal we can never achieve\", the reward comes from the trying. paul makes a clear claim that we are to continue straining for the prize over in philippians 3:10-16. only by not living out the commands do we stagnate and become lukewarm, to be spit out by jesus. as it says in 1 john 5:3: \"this is love for god: to obey his comands.\" that obedience is our straining to achieve for god. of course, this requires work on our part. as for the quote in james, satan doesn't care what we believe. what matters is the results of our belief (works). if one truly has faith in what one believes, one will either act on that faith or be lying to oneself about believing in the first place. stan, as for your first line, you have a very good point. obedience by obligation (grudgery) is not what god desires. instead, look at how many times the bible talks about being joyous in all situations and when doing god's work. being begrudged by the work has no value. also, we should do the work necessary whenever we can, not just when we feel jesus' presence. feelings can deceive us. however, as paul states to timothy in 2 timothy 4:2: \"preach the word; be prepared in season and out of season; correct, rebuke and encourage--with great patience and careful instruction.\" also, remember that paul tells timothy in 1 timothy 4:16: \"watch your life and doctrine closely. persevere in them, because if you do, you will save both yourself and your hearers.\" so, in order to do the work necessary, we need to be sure that we are correct first. remember jesus' warning in matthew 7:3-5 not to be hypocritical about what we do. the best way to accomplish this is to be a disciple completely in both thought and deed.",
